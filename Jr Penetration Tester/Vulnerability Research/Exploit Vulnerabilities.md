| **Advantage**                                                | **Disadvantage**                                             |

| Automated scans are easy to repeat, and the results can be shared within a team with ease. | People can often become reliant on these tools.              |
| These scanners are quick and can test numerous applications efficiently. | They are extremely "loud" and produce a lot of traffic and logging. This is  not good if you are trying to bypass firewalls and the likes. |
| Open-source solutions exist.                                 | Open-source solutions are often basic and require expensive licenses to have useful features. |
| Automated scanners cover a wide range of different vulnerabilities that may be hard to manually search for. | They often do not find every vulnerability on an application. |

| **Vulnerability**          | **Description**                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Security Misconfigurations | Security misconfigurations involve vulnerabilities that are due to developer  oversight. For example, exposing server information in messages between  the application and an attacker. |
| Broken Access Control      | This vulnerability occurs when an attacker is able to access parts of an  application that they are not supposed to be able to otherwise. |
| Insecure Deserialization   | This is the insecure processing of data that is sent across an application.  An attacker may be able to pass malicious code to the application, where it will then be executed. |
| Injection                  | An  Injection vulnerability exists when an attacker is able to input  malicious data into an application. This is due to the failure of not  ensuring (known as sanitising) input is not harmful. |

# Finding Manual Exploits                            

**Rapid7**

Much like other services such as Exploit DB and NVE, Rapid7 is a  vulnerability research database. The only difference being that this  database also acts as an exploit database. Using this service, you can filter by type of vulnerability (I.e. application and operating system).

Additionally, the database contains instructions for exploiting applications using  the popular Metasploit tool (you will learn about this tool in-depth later in the learning path). For example, this entry on [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/db/) is for “[Wordpress Plugin SP Project & Document](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/http/wp_plugin_sp_project_document_rce/)”, where we can see instructions on how to use an exploit module to abuse this vulnerability.

**GitHub**

[GitHub ](https://github.com)is a popular web service designed for software developers. The site is  used to host and share the source code of applications to allow a  collaborative effort. However, security  researchers have taken to this platform because of the aforementioned  reasons as well. Security researchers store & share PoC’s (Proof of  Concept) on GitHub, turning it into an exploit database in this context.

GitHub is extremely useful in finding rare or fresh exploits because anyone  can create an account and upload – there is no formal verification  process like there is with alternative exploit databases. With that  said, there is also a downside in that PoC’s may not work where little  to no support will be provided.

GitHub uses a tagging and keyword system, meaning that we can search GitHub by keywords such as “PoC”, “vulnerability”, and many more. At the time of  writing, there are 9,682 repositories with the keyword “cve”. We are also able to filter the results by programming language.

**Searchsploit**

Searchsploit is a tool that is available on popular pentesting distributions such as Kali Linux. It is also available on the TryHackMe AttackBox. This tool is an  offline copy of Exploit-DB, containing copies of exploits on your  system. 

You are able to search  searchsploit by application name and/or vulnerability type. For example, in the snippet below, we are searching searchsploit for exploits  relating to Wordpress that we can use – no downloading necessary!

​        Using Searchsploit to look for exploits relating to "Wordpress"        

```bash
