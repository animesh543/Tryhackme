#  Introduction to Vulnerabilities

A vulnerability in cybersecurity is defined as a weakness or flaw in the design, implementation or behaviors of a system or application. An attacker can exploit these weaknesses to gain access to unauthorised information or perform unauthorized actions. The term “vulnerability” has many definitions by cybersecurity bodies. However, there is minimal variation between them all. 

| **Vulnerability**           | **Description**                                              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Operating System            | These types of vulnerabilities are found within Operating Systems (OSs) and often result in privilege escalation. |
| (Mis)Configuration-based    | These types of vulnerability stem from an incorrectly configured application  or service. For example, a website exposing customer details. |
| Weak or Default Credentials | Applications and services that have an element of authentication will come with  default credentials when installed. For example, an administrator  dashboard may have the username and password of "admin". These are easy  to guess by an attacker. |
| Application Logic           | These vulnerabilities are a result of poorly designed applications. For  example, poorly implemented authentication mechanisms that may result in an attacker being able to impersonate a user. |
| Human-Factor                | Human-Factor vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities that leverage human behaviour. For example, phishing emails are designed to trick humans into believing they are legitimate. |

# Scoring Vulnerabilities (CVSS & VPR)                            

Vulnerability management is the process of evaluating, categorising and ultimately remediating threats (vulnerabilities) faced by an organisation.

It is arguably impossible to patch and remedy every single vulnerability in a network or computer system and sometimes a waste of resources. 

After all, only approximately 2% of vulnerabilities only ever end up being exploited ([Kenna security., 2020](https://www.kennasecurity.com/resources/prioritization-to-prediction-report/)). Instead, it is all about addressing the most dangerous vulnerabilities and reducing the likelihood of an attack vector being used to exploit a system.

**Common Vulnerability Scoring System**

First introduced in 2005, the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (or CVSS) is a very popular framework for vulnerability scoring and has three  major iterations. As it stands, the current version is CVSSv3.1 (with  version 4.0 currently in draft) a score is essentially determined by  some of the following factors (but many more):

1. How easy is it to exploit the vulnerability?

2. Do exploits exist for this?

3. How does this vulnerability interfere with the CIA triad?

In fact, there are so many variables that you have to use a [calculator ](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator)to figure out the score using this framework. A vulnerability is given a  classification (out of five) depending on the score that is has been  assigned. I have put the Qualitative Severity Rating Scale and their  score ranges into the table below. 

| **Rating** | **Score**  |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| None       | 0          |
| Low        | 0.1 - 3.9  |
| Medium     | 4.0 - 6.9  |
| High       | 7.0 - 8.9  |
| Critical   | 9.0 - 10.0 |

However, CVSS is not a magic bullet. Let's analyse some of the advantages and disadvantages of CVSS in the table below:

| **Advantages of CVSS**                                       | **Disadvantages of CVSS**                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CVSS has been around for a long time.                        | CVSS was never designed to help prioritise vulnerabilities, instead, just assign a value of severity. |
| CVSS is popular in organisations.                            | CVSS heavily assesses vulnerabilities on an exploit being available.  However, only 20% of all vulnerabilities have an exploit available ([Tenable., 2020](https://www.tenable.com/research)) . |
| CVSS is a free framework to adopt and recommended by organisations such as NIST. | Vulnerabilities rarely change scoring after assessment despite the fact that new developments such as exploits may be found. |





**Vulnerability Priority Rating (VPR)**

The VPR framework is a much more modern framework in vulnerability management - developed by Tenable, an industry solutions provider for vulnerability  management. This framework is considered to be risk-driven; meaning that vulnerabilities are given a score with a heavy focus on the risk a  vulnerability poses to the organisation itself, rather than factors such as impact (like with CVSS).

Unlike CVSS, VPR scoring takes into account the relevancy of a vulnerability. For  example, no risk is considered regarding a vulnerability if that  vulnerability does not apply to the organisation (i.e. they do not use  the software that is vulnerable). VPR is also considerably dynamic in  its scoring, where the risk that a vulnerability may pose can change  almost daily as it ages.

VPR uses a similar scoring range as CVSS, which I have also put into the  table below. However, two notable differences are that VPR does not have a *"None/Informational"* category, and because VPR uses a different scoring method, the same vulnerability will have a different score using VPR than when using CVSS.

| **Rating** | **Score**  |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Low        | 0.0 - 3.9  |
| Medium     | 4.0 - 6.9  |
| High       | 7.0 - 8.9  |
| Critical   | 9.0 - 10.0 |


Let's recap some of the advantages and disadvantages of using the VPR framework in the table below.

| **Advantages of VPR**                                        | **Disadvantages of VPR**                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| VPR is a modern framework that is real-world.                | VPR is not open-source like some other vulnerability management frameworks. |
| VPR considers over 150 factors when calculating risk.        | VPR can only be adopted apart of a commercial platform.      |
| VPR is risk-driven and used by organisations to help prioritise patching vulnerabilities. | VPR does not consider the CIA triad to the extent that CVSS does; meaning  that risk to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data  does not play a large factor in scoring vulnerabilities when using VPR. |
| Scorings are not final and are very dynamic, meaning the priority a  vulnerability should be given can change as the vulnerability ages. | *Intentionally left blank.*                                  |

#  Vulnerability Databases                            

Throughout  your journey in cybersecurity, you will often come across a magnitude of different applications and services. For  example, a CMS whilst they all have the same purpose, often have very different designs and behaviours (and, in turn, potentially  different vulnerabilities).

Thankfully for us, there are resources on the internet that keep track of vulnerabilities for all sorts of software, operating systems and more! This room will showcase two databases that we can use to look up existing vulnerabilities for applications discovered in our infosec journey, specifically the following websites: 

1. [NVD (National Vulnerability Database)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/full-listing)

2. [Exploit-DB](http://exploit-db.com)

Before we dive into these two resources, let's ensure that our understanding of some fundamental key terms is on the same page:

| **Term**               | **Definition**                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Vulnerability          | A vulnerability is defined as a weakness or flaw in the design, implementation or behaviours of a system or application. |
| Exploit                | An exploit is something such as an action or behaviour that utilises a vulnerability on a system or application. |
| Proof of Concept (PoC) | A PoC is a technique or tool that often demonstrates the exploitation of a vulnerability. |

## NVD – National Vulnerability Database

The National Vulnerability Database is a website that lists all publically categorised vulnerabilities. In cybersecurity, vulnerabilities are classified under “**C**ommon **V**ulnerabilities and **E**xposures” (Or CVE for short). 

These CVEs have the formatting of `CVE-YEAR-IDNUMBER`. For example, the vulnerability that the famous malware WannaCry used was `CVE-2017-0144.`
