# Introduction                            

The ability to upload files to a server has become an integral part  of how we interact with web applications. Be it a profile picture for a  social media website, a report being uploaded to cloud storage, or  saving a project on Github; the applications for file upload features  are limitless.

Unfortunately, when handled badly, file uploads can also open up severe vulnerabilities in the server. This can lead to  anything from relatively minor, nuisance problems; all the way up to  full Remote Code Execution (RCE) if an attacker manages to upload and  execute a shell. With unrestricted upload access to a server (and the  ability to retrieve data at will), an attacker could deface or otherwise alter existing content -- up to and including injecting malicious  webpages, which lead to further vulnerabilities such as XSS or CSRF. By  uploading arbitrary files, an attacker could potentially also use the  server to host and/or serve illegal content, or to leak sensitive  information. Realistically speaking, an attacker with the ability to  upload a file of their choice to your server -- with no restrictions --  is very dangerous indeed.

The purpose of this room is to  explore some of the vulnerabilities resulting from improper (or  inadequate) handling of file uploads. Specifically, we will be looking  at:

- Overwriting existing files on a server
- Uploading and Executing Shells on a server
- Bypassing Client-Side filtering
- Bypassing various kinds of Server-Side filtering
- Fooling content type validation checks

# General Methodology                            

So, we have a file upload point on a site. How would we go about exploiting it?

As with any kind of hacking, enumeration is key. The more we understand about our environment, the more we're able to *do* with it. Looking at the source code for the page is good to see if any  kind of client-side filtering is being applied. Scanning with a  directory bruteforcer such as Gobuster is usually helpful in web  attacks, and may reveal where files are being uploaded to; Gobuster is  no longer installed by default on Kali, but can be installed with `sudo apt install gobuster`. Intercepting upload requests with [Burpsuite](https://blog.tryhackme.com/setting-up-burp/) will also come in handy. Browser extensions such as [Wappalyser](https://www.wappalyzer.com/download) can provide valuable information at a glance about the site you're targetting.

With a basic understanding of how the website might be handling our input,  we can then try to poke around and see what we can and can't upload. If  the website is employing client-side filtering then we can easily look  at the code for the filter and look to bypass it (more on this later!).  If the website has server-side filtering in place then we may need to  take a guess at what the filter is looking for, upload a file, then try  something slightly different based on the error message if the upload  fails. Uploading files designed to provoke errors can help with this.  Tools like Burpsuite or OWASP Zap can be very helpful at this stage. 

We'll go into a lot more detail about bypassing filters in later tasks.

#  Overwriting Existing Files                            

When files are uploaded to the server, a range of checks should be  carried out to ensure that the file will not overwrite anything which  already exists on the server. Common practice is to assign the file with a new name -- often either random, or with the date and time of upload  added to the start or end of the original filename. Alternatively,  checks may be applied to see if the filename already exists on the  server; if a file with the same name already exists then the server will return an error message asking the user to pick a different file name.  File permissions also come into play when protecting existing files from being overwritten. Web pages, for example, should not be writeable to  the web user, thus preventing them from being overwritten with a  malicious version uploaded by an attacker.

 If, however, no such  precautions are taken, then we might potentially be able to overwrite  existing files on the server. Realistically speaking, the chances are  that file permissions on the server will prevent this from being a  serious vulnerability. That said, it could still be quite the nuisance,  and is worth keeping an eye out for in a pentest or bug hunting  environment. 



Let's go through an example before you try this for yourself. *Please note that* `demo.uploadvulns.thm` *will be used for all demonstrations; however, **this site is not available in the uploaded VM**. It is purely for demonstrative purposes.*

In the following image we have a web page with an upload form:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/7KmsrTW.png)

You may need to enumerate more than this for a real challenge; however, in  this instance, let's just take a look at the source code of the page:



![img](https://i.imgur.com/BeqAZ3s.png)

Inside the red box, we see the code that's responsible for displaying the  image that we saw on the page. It's being sourced from a file called  "spaniel.jpg", inside a directory called "images".

Now we know where the image is being pulled from -- can we overwrite it?

Let's download another image from the internet and call it `spaniel.jpg`. We'll then upload it to the site and see if we can overwrite the existing image:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/8PiIuiu.png)

![img](https://i.imgur.com/TIoA2DR.png)

And our attack was successful! We managed to overwrite the original `images/spaniel.jpg` with our own copy.

# Remote Code Execution                            

It's all well and good overwriting files that exist on the server.  That's a nuisance to the person maintaining the site, and may lead to  some vulnerabilities, but let's go further; let's go for RCE!

Remote Code Execution (as the name suggests) would allow us to execute code  arbitrarily on the web server. Whilst this is likely to be as a  low-privileged web user account (such as `www-data` on Linux servers), it's still an extremely serious vulnerability. Remote code  execution through a web application tends to be a result of uploading a  program written in the same language as the back-end of the website (or  another language which the server understands and will execute).  Traditionally this would be PHP, however, in more recent times, other  back-end languages have become more common (Python Django and Javascript in the form of Node.js being prime examples).

There  are two basic ways to achieve RCE on a webserver: webshells, and reverse shells. Realistically a fully featured reverse shell is the ideal goal  for an attacker; however, a webshell may be the only option available  (for example, if a file length limit has been imposed on uploads). We'll take a look at each of these in turn. As a general methodology, we  would be looking to upload a shell of one kind or another, then  activating it, either by navigating directly to the file if the server  allows it, or by otherwise forcing the webapp to run the script for us.

------

*Web shells:*

Let's assume that we've found a webpage with an upload form:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/GxMJAKH.png)*
*

Where do we go from here? Well, let's start with a gobuster scan:![img](https://i.imgur.com/OftwAIE.png)

Looks like we've got two directories here -- `uploads` and `assets`. Of these, it seems likely that any files we upload will be placed in  the "uploads" directory. We'll try uploading a legitimate image file  first. Here I am choosing our  cute dog photo from the previous task:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/aAyIrod.png)

![img](https://i.imgur.com/mIbGRIk.png)

Now, if we go to `http://demo.uploadvulns.thm/uploads` we should see that the spaniel picture has been uploaded!

![img](https://i.imgur.com/lVe2tjL.png)

![img](https://i.imgur.com/N8vWlVO.png)

Ok, we can upload images. Let's try a webshell now.

As it is, we know that this webserver is running with a PHP back-end, so we'll skip straight to creating and uploading the shell.  In real life, we may need to do a little more enumeration; however, PHP  is a good place to start regardless. 

A simple webshell works by taking a parameter and executing it as a system command. In PHP, the syntax for this would be:

```php
<?php
    echo system($_GET["cmd"]);
?>
```

This code takes a GET parameter and executes it as a system command. It then echoes the output out to the screen.

Let's try uploading it to the site, then using it to show our current user and the contents of the current directory:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/CU0Uyx5.png)



Success!

We could now use this shell to read files from the system, or upgrade from here to a reverse shell. Now that we have RCE, the options are  limitless. Note that when using webshells, it's usually easier to view  the output by looking at the source code of the page. This drastically  improves the formatting of the output.

------

***Reverse Shells:***

The process for uploading a reverse shell is almost identical to that of  uploading a webshell, so this section will be shorter. We'll be using  the ubiquitous Pentest Monkey reverse shell, which comes by default on  Kali Linux, but can also be downloaded [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php). You will need to edit line 49 of the shell. It will currently say `$ip = '127.0.0.1'; // CHANGE THIS` -- as it instructs, change `127.0.0.1` to your TryHackMe tun0 IP address, which can be found on the [access page](https://tryhackme.com/access). You can ignore the following line, which also asks to be changed. With  the shell edited, the next thing we need to do is start a Netcat  listener to receive the connection. `nc -lvnp 1234`:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/ysY306E.png)

Now, let's upload the shell, then activate it by navigating to `http://demo.uploadvulns.thm/uploads/shell.php`. The name of the shell will obviously be whatever you called it (`php-reverse-shell.php` by default).

The website should hang and not load properly -- however, if we switch back to our terminal, we have a hit!

![img](https://i.imgur.com/he0hbiR.png)

Once again, we have obtained RCE on this webserver. From here we would want  to stabilise our shell and escalate our privileges, but those are tasks  for another time. For now, it's time you tried this for yourself!

# Filtering                            

Up until now we have largely been ignoring the counter-defences  employed by web developers to defend against file upload  vulnerabilities. Every website that you've successfully attacked so far  in this room has been completely insecure. It's time that changed. From  here on out, we'll be looking at some of the defence mechanisms used to  prevent malicious file uploads, and how to circumvent them.

------

First up, let's discuss the differences between *client*-side filtering and *server*-side filtering. 

When we talk about a script being "Client-Side", in the context of web  applications, we mean that it's running in the user's browser as opposed to on the web server itself. JavaScript is pretty much ubiquitous as  the client-side scripting language, although alternatives do exist.  Regardless of the language  being used, a client-side script will be run in your web browser. In the context of file-uploads, this means that the filtering occurs before  the file is even uploaded to the server. Theoretically, this would seem  like a good thing, right? In an ideal world, it would be; however,  because the filtering is happening on *our* computer, it is  trivially easy to bypass. As such client-side filtering by itself is a  highly insecure method of verifying that an uploaded file is not  malicious.

Conversely, as you may have guessed, a *server*-side script will be run on the server. Traditionally PHP was the  predominant server-side language (with Microsoft's ASP for IIS coming in close second); however, in recent years, other  options (C#, Node.js, Python, Ruby on Rails, and a variety of others)  have become more widely used. Server-side filtering tends to be more  difficult to bypass, as you don't have the code in front of you. As the  code is executed on the server, in most cases it will also be impossible to bypass the filter completely; instead we have to form a payload  which conforms to the filters in place, but still allows us to execute  our code. 

------

With that in mind, let's take a look at some different kinds of filtering.

## *Extension Validation:*

File extensions are used (in theory) to identify the contents of a file. In  practice they are very easy to change, so actually don't mean much;  however, MS Windows still uses them to identify file types, although  Unix based systems tend to rely on other methods, which we'll cover in a bit. Filters that check for extensions work in one of two ways. They  either *blacklist* extensions (i.e. have a list of extensions which are **not** allowed) or they *whitelist* extensions (i.e. have a list of extensions which **are** allowed, and reject everything else).

 ## *File Type Filtering:*

Similar to Extension validation, but more intensive, file type filtering looks, once again, to verify that the contents of a file are acceptable to  upload. We'll be looking at two types of file type validation:

- *MIME validation:* MIME (**M**ultipurpose **I**nternet **M**ail **E**xtension) types are used as an identifier for files -- originally when transfered as attachments over email, but now also when files are being  transferred over HTTP(S). The MIME type for a file upload is attached in the header of the request, and looks something like this:
  ![img](https://i.imgur.com/uptWRKW.png)

  MIME types follow the format <type>/<subtype>. In the request  above, you can see that the image "spaniel.jpg" was uploaded to the  server. As a legitimate JPEG image, the MIME type for this upload was  "image/jpeg". The MIME type for a file can be checked client-side and/or server-side; however, as MIME is based on the extension of the file,  this is extremely easy to bypass.

  

- *Magic Number validation**:*** Magic numbers are the more accurate way of determining the contents of a  file; although, they are by no means impossible to fake. The "magic  number" of a file is a string of bytes at the very beginning of the file content which identify the content. For example, a PNG file would have  these bytes at the very top of the file: `89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A`.
  ![img](https://i.imgur.com/vHQWOgi.png)
  Unlike Windows, Unix systems use magic numbers for identifying files; however, when dealing with file uploads, it is possible to check the magic  number of the uploaded file to ensure that it is safe to accept. This is by no means a guaranteed solution, but it's more effective than  checking the extension of a file.

## *File Length Filtering:*

File length filters are used to prevent huge files from being uploaded to  the server via an upload form (as this can potentially starve the server of resources). In most cases this will not cause us any issues when we  upload shells; however, it's worth bearing in mind that if an upload  form only expects a very small file to be uploaded, there may be a  length filter in place to ensure that the file length requirement is  adhered to. As an example, our fully fledged PHP reverse shell from the previous task is 5.4Kb big -- relatively tiny,  but if the form expects a maximum of 2Kb then we would need to find an  alternative shell to upload.

## *File Name Filtering:*

As touched upon previously, files uploaded to a server should be unique.  Usually this would mean adding a random aspect to the file name,  however, an alternative strategy would be to check if a file with the  same name already exists on the server, and give the user an error if  so. Additionally, file names should be sanitised on upload to ensure  that they don't contain any "bad characters", which could potentially  cause problems on the file system when uploaded (e.g. null bytes or  forward slashes on Linux, as well as control characters such as `;` and potentially unicode characters). What this means for us is that, on a well administered system, our uploaded files are unlikely to have the same name we gave them before uploading, so be aware that you may have  to go hunting for your shell in the event that you manage to bypass the  content filtering.

## *File Content Filtering:*

More  complicated  filtering systems may scan the full contents of an uploaded file to  ensure that it's not spoofing its extension, MIME type and Magic Number. This is a significantly more complex process than the majority of basic filtration systems employ, and thus will not be covered in this room.

------

It's worth noting that none of these filters are perfect by themselves --  they will usually be used in conjunction with each other, providing a  multi-layered filter, thus increasing the security of the upload  significantly. Any of these filters can all be applied client-side,  server-side, or both.

Similarly, different frameworks and  languages come with their own inherent methods of filtering and  validating uploaded files. As a result, it is possible for language  specific exploits to appear; for example, until PHP major version five, it was possible to bypass an extension filter by  appending a null byte, followed by a valid extension, to the malicious `.php` file. More recently it was also possible to inject PHP code into the exif data of an otherwise valid image file, then force  the server to execute it. These are things that you are welcome to  research further, should you be interested.

# Bypassing Client-Side Filtering                            

We'll begin with the first (and weakest) line of defence: Client-Side Filtering.

As mentioned previously, client-side filtering tends to be extremely easy to bypass, as it occurs entirely on a machine that *you* control. When you have access to the code, it's very easy to alter it.

There are four easy ways to bypass your average client-side file upload filter:

1. *Turn off Javascript in your browser* -- this will work provided the site doesn't require Javascript in order to provide basic functionality. If turning off Javascript completely will  prevent the site from working at all then one of the other methods would be more desirable; otherwise, this can be an effective way of  completely bypassing the client-side filter.
2. *Intercept and modify the incoming page.* Using Burpsuite, we can intercept the incoming web page and strip out the  Javascript filter before it has a chance to run. The process for this  will be covered below.
3. *Intercept and modify the file upload*. Where the previous method works *before* the webpage is loaded, this method allows the web page to load as normal,  but intercepts the file upload after it's already passed (and been  accepted by the filter). Again, we will cover the process for using this method in the course of the task.
4. *Send the file directly to the upload point.* Why use the webpage with the filter, when you can send the file directly using a tool like `curl`? Posting the data directly to the page which contains the code for  handling the file upload is another effective method for completely  bypassing a client side filter. We will not be covering this method in  any real depth in this tutorial, however, the syntax for such a command  would look something like this: `curl -X POST -F "submit:<value>" -F "<file-parameter>:@<path-to-file>" <site>`. To use this method you would first aim to intercept a successful upload (using Burpsuite or the browser console) to see the parameters being  used in the upload, which can then be slotted into the above command.

We will be covering methods two and three in depth below.

------



Let's assume that, once again, we have found an upload page on a website:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/fI67jX0.png)

As always, we'll take a look at the source code. Here we see a basic  Javascript function checking for the MIME type of uploaded files:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/TrI5jQD.png)

In this instance we can see that the filter is using a *whitelist* to exclude any MIME type that isn't `image/jpeg`.

Our next step is to attempt a file upload -- as expected, if we choose a  JPEG, the function accepts it. Anything else and the upload is rejected.

Having established this, let's start [Burpsuite](https://blog.tryhackme.com/setting-up-burp/) and  reload the page. We will see our own request to the site, but what we really want to see is the server's *response*, so right click on the intercepted data, scroll down to "Do Intercept", then select "Response to this request":

![img](https://i.imgur.com/T0RjAry.png)

When we click the "Forward" button at the top of the window, we will then  see the server's response to our request. Here we can delete, comment  out, or otherwise break the Javascript function before it has a chance  to load:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/ACgWLpH.png)

Having deleted the function, we once again click "Forward" until the site has  finished loading, and are now free to upload any kind of file to the  website:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/5cyqjqa.png)

It's worth noting here that Burpsuite will not, by default, intercept any  external Javascript files that the web page is loading. If you need to  edit a script which is not inside the main page being loaded, you'll  need to go to the "Options" tab at the top of the Burpsuite window, then under the "Intercept Client Requests" section, edit the condition of  the first line to remove `^js$|`:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/95hi6pX.png)

------

We've already bypassed this filter by intercepting and removing it prior to  the page being loaded, but let's try doing it by uploading a file with a legitimate extension and MIME type, then intercepting and correcting  the upload with Burpsuite.

Having reloaded the webpage to put the  filter back in place, let's take the reverse shell that we used before  and rename it to be called "shell.jpg". As the MIME type (based on the  file extension) automatically checks out, the Client-Side filter lets  our payload through without complaining:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/WNpruFM.png)

Once again we'll activate our Burpsuite intercept, then click "Upload" and catch the request:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/h2164Li.png)

Observe that the MIME type of our PHP shell is currently `image/jpeg`. We'll change this to `text/x-php`, and the file extension from `.jpg` to `.php`, then forward the request to the server:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/sqmwssT.png)

Now, when we navigate to `http://demo.uploadvulns.thm/uploads/shell.php` having set up a netcat listener, we receive a connection from the shell!

![img](https://i.imgur.com/cUqNO2L.png)

# Bypassing Server-Side Filtering: File Extensions                            

Time to turn things up another notch!

Client-side filters are  easy to bypass -- you can see the code for them, even if it's been  obfuscated and needs processed before you can read it; but what happens  when you *can't* see or manipulate the code? Well, that's a  server-side filter. In short, we have to perform a lot of testing to  build up an idea of what is or is not allowed through the filter, then  gradually put together a payload which conforms to the restrictions. 

For the first part of this task we'll take a look at a website that's using a blacklist for file extensions as a server side filter. There are a  variety of different ways that this could be coded, and the bypass we  use is dependent on that. In the real world we wouldn't be able to see  the code for this, but for this example, it will be included here:

```php
<?php
    //Get the extension
    $extension = pathinfo($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["name"])["extension"];
    //Check the extension against the blacklist -- .php and .phtml
    switch($extension){
        case "php":
        case "phtml":
        case NULL:
            $uploadFail = True;
            break;
        default:
            $uploadFail = False;
    }
?>
```

In this instance, the code is looking for the last period (`.`) in the file name and uses that to confirm the extension, so that is  what we'll be trying to bypass here. Other ways the code could be  working include: searching for the first period in the file name, or  splitting the file name at each period and checking to see if any  blacklisted extensions show up. We'll cover this latter case later on,  but in the meantime, let's focus on the code we've got here.

We can see that the code is filtering out the `.php` and `.phtml` extensions, so if we want to upload a PHP script we're going to have to find another extension. The [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) for PHP gives us a few common extensions that we can try; however,  there are actually a variety of other more rarely used extensions  available that webservers may nonetheless still recognise. These  include: `.php3`, `.php4`, `.php5`, `.php7`, `.phps`, `.php-s`, `.pht` and `.phar`. Many of these bypass the filter (which only blocks`.php` and `.phtml`), but it appears that the server is configured not to recognise them as PHP files, as in the below example: 

![img](https://i.imgur.com/yzOGVob.png)

This is actually the default for Apache2 servers, at the time of writing;  however, the sysadmin may have changed the default configuration (or the server may be out of date), so it's well worth trying. 

Eventually we find that the `.phar` extension bypasses the filter -- and works -- thus giving us our shell:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/Aigaz4R.png)



------

Let's have a look at another example, with a different filter. This time  we'll do it completely black-box: i.e. without the source code.

Once again, we have our upload form:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/STsI51E.png)

Ok, we'll start by scoping this out with a completely legitimate upload. Let's try uploading the `spaniel.jpg` image from before:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/tp6T2WH.png)

Well, that tells us that JPEGS are accepted at least. Let's go for one that we can be pretty sure will be rejected (`shell.php`):

![img](https://i.imgur.com/hk4inJ2.png)

Can't say that was unexpected.

From here we enumerate further, trying the techniques from above and just  generally trying to get an idea of what the filter will accept or  reject.

In this case we find that there are no shell  extensions that both execute, and are not filtered, so it's back to the  drawing board. 

In the previous example we saw that the code was using the `pathinfo()` PHP function to get the last few characters after the `.`, but what happens if it filters the input slightly differently?

Let's try uploading a file called `shell.jpg.php`. We already know that JPEG files are accepted, so what if the filter is just checking to see if the `.jpg` file extension is somewhere within the input?

Pseudocode for this kind of filter may look something like this:

```
ACCEPT FILE FROM THE USER -- SAVE FILENAME IN VARIABLE userInput
IF STRING ".jpg" IS IN VARIABLE userInput:
    SAVE THE FILE
ELSE:
    RETURN ERROR MESSAGE
```

When we try to upload our file we get a success message. Navigating to the `/uploads` directory confirms that the payload was successfully uploaded:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/K55eu9o.png)

Activating it, we receive our shell:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/VVAKZfw.png)

------

This is by no means an exhaustive list of upload vulnerabilities related to  file extensions. As with everything in hacking, we are looking to  exploit flaws in code that others have written; this code may very well  be uniquely written for the task at hand. This is the really important  point to take away from this task: there are a million different ways to implement the same feature when it comes to programming -- your  exploitation must be tailored to the filter at hand. The key to  bypassing any kind  of server side filter is to enumerate and see what is allowed, as well  as what is blocked; then try to craft a payload which can pass the  criteria the filter is looking for.

# Bypassing Server-Side Filtering: Magic Numbers                            

We've already had a look at server-side extension filtering, but  let's also take the opportunity to see how magic number checking could  be implemented as a server-side filter.

As mentioned previously,  magic numbers are used as a more accurate identifier of files. The magic number of a file is a string of hex digits, and is always the very  first thing in a file. Knowing this, it's possible to use magic numbers  to validate file uploads, simply by reading those first few bytes and  comparing them against either a whitelist or a blacklist. Bear in mind  that this technique can be very effective against a PHP based webserver; however, it can sometimes fail against other types of webserver (hint  hint).

Let's take a look at an example. As per usual, we have an upload page:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/yQnQGsn.png)

As expected, if we upload our standard shell.php file, we get an error;  however, if we upload a JPEG, the website is fine with it. All running  as per expected so far.

From the previous attempt at an upload, we know that JPEG files are accepted, so let's try adding the JPEG magic  number to the top of our `shell.php` file. A quick look at the [list of file signatures on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures) shows us that there are several possible magic numbers of JPEG files.  It shouldn't matter which we use here, so let's just pick one (`FF D8 FF DB`). We could add the ASCII representation of these digits (ÿØÿÛ) directly  to the top of the file but it's often easier to work directly with the  hexadecimal representation, so let's cover that method. 

Before we get started, let's use the Linux `file` command to check the file type of our shell:

As expected, the command tells us that the filetype is PHP. Keep this in mind as we proceed with the explanation.

We can see that the magic number we've chosen is four bytes long, so let's open up the reverse shell script and add four random characters on the  first line. These characters do not matter, so for this example we'll  just use four "A"s:

Save the file and exit. Next we're going to reopen the file in `hexeditor` (which comes by default on Kali), or any other tool which allows you to see and edit the shell as hex. In hexeditor the file looks like this:

Note the four bytes in the red box: they are all `41`, which is the hex code for a capital "A" -- exactly what we added at the top of the file previously.

Change this to the magic number we found earlier for JPEG files: `FF D8 FF DB`

Now if we save and exit the file (Ctrl + x), we can use `file` once again, and see that we have successfully spoofed the filetype of our shell:

Perfect. Now let's try uploading the modified shell and see if it bypasses the filter!

There we have it -- we bypassed the server-side magic number filter and received a reverse shell. 

# Example Methodology                            

We'll look at this as a step-by-step process. Let's say that we've been given a website to perform a security audit on.

1. The first thing we would do is take a look at the website as a whole. Using browser extensions such as the aforementioned Wappalyzer (or by hand)  we would look for indicators of what languages and frameworks the web  application might have been built with. Be aware that Wappalyzer is not  always 100% accurate. A good start to enumerating this manually would be by making a request to the website and intercepting the response with  Burpsuite. Headers such as `server` or `x-powered-by` can be used to gain information about the server. We would also be  looking for vectors of attack, like, for example, an upload page. 
2. Having found an upload page, we would then aim to inspect it further. Looking  at the source code for client-side scripts to determine if there are any client-side filters to bypass would be a good thing to start with, as  this is completely in our control.
3. We would then attempt a  completely innocent file upload. From here we would look to see how our  file is accessed. In other words, can we access it directly in an  uploads folder? Is it embedded in a page somewhere? What's the naming  scheme of the website? This is where tools such as Gobuster might come  in if the location is not immediately obvious. This step is extremely  important as it not only improves our knowledge of the virtual landscape we're attacking, it also gives us a baseline "accepted" file which we  can base further testing on. 
   - An important Gobuster switch here is the `-x` switch, which can be used to look for files with specific extensions. For example, if you added `-x php,txt,html` to your Gobuster command, the tool would append `.php`, `.txt`, and `.html` to each word in the selected wordlist, one at a time. This can be very  useful if you've managed to upload a payload and the server is changing  the name of uploaded files.
4. Having ascertained how and where our uploaded files can be accessed, we would then attempt a  malicious file upload, bypassing any client-side filters we found in  step two. We would expect our upload to be stopped by a server side  filter, but the error message that it gives us can be extremely useful  in determining our next steps.

Assuming that our malicious  file upload has been stopped by the server, here are some ways to  ascertain what kind of server-side filter may be in place:

- If you can successfully upload a file with a totally invalid file extension (e.g. `testingimage.invalidfileextension`) then the chances are that the server is using an extension *blacklist* to filter out executable files. If this upload fails then any extension filter will be operating on a whitelist.
- Try re-uploading your originally accepted innocent file, but this time  change the magic number of the file to be something that you would  expect to be filtered. If the upload fails then you know that the server is using a magic number based filter.
- As with the previous  point, try to upload your innocent file, but intercept the request with  Burpsuite and change the MIME type of the upload to something that you  would expect to be filtered. If the upload fails then you know that the  server is filtering based on MIME types.
- Enumerating file length filters is a case of uploading a small file, then uploading  progressively bigger files until you hit the filter. At that point  you'll know what the acceptable limit is. If you're very lucky then the  error message of original upload may outright tell you what the size  limit is. Be aware that a small file length limit may prevent you from  uploading the reverse shell we've been using so far.
