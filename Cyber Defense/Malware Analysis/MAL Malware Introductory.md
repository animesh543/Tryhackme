# What is the Purpose of Malware Analysis?

Malware is such a prevalent topic within Cybersecurity, and often an unfortunately recurring theme among global news today.

Not only is malware analysis a form of incidence response, but it is also  useful in understanding how the behaviours of variants of malware result in their respective categorisation. This room will be a practical  introduction to the techniques and tools used throughout  malware analysis - albeit brief, I hope to expand on these techniques a  lot more in-depth within the future.

When analysing malware, it is important to consider the following:

- Point of Entry (PoE) I.e. Was it through spam that our e-mail filtering  missed and the user opened the attachment? Let's review our spam filters and train our users better for future prevention!

- What are the indicators that malware has even been executed on a machine?  Are there any files, processes, or perhaps any attempt of "un-ordinary"  communication?

- How does the malware perform? Does it attempt to infect other devices? Does it encrypt files or install anything like a backdoor / Remote Access  Tool (RAT)?

- Most importantly - can we ultimately prevent and/or detect further infection?!

# Identifying if a Malware Attack has Happened

Much like any interaction with an Operating System, there is always remnants of such activity even if there is little trace...

~~Un~~fortunately, **m****alware** (dependant on its variant) **is largely obtrusive** - in the sense that it leaves quite an extensive papertrail of evidence...Perfect for us analysers!

The ultimate process of a malware attack can be broken down into a few broad steps:

1. Delivery
2. Execution
3. Maintaining persistence (not always the case!)
4. Propagation (not always!)

**These steps will generate lots of data.** Namely: network traffic such as communicating with hosts, file system interaction like read/writes and modification.

Malware is essentially classified based upon the behaviours it produces to perform the steps listed above. For a famous example, Wannacry performs all four of these steps.

﻿1. Delivery

This could be of many methods, to name a few: USB (Stuxnet!), PDF  attachments through "Phising" campaigns or vulnerability enumeration.

2. Execution

Here's the main part of how we classify Malware. What does it actually do? If  it encrypts files - it's Ransomware! If it records information like keystrokes or displays adware - we can classify it as Spyware.

**We only understand this stage through analysing the sample, which is why analysis is important - and is what we'll be covering.**

3. Maintaining Persistence

It wouldn't make much sense for Malware authors to go through all the  trouble of developing a piece of code that is capable of execution -  just for it to execute and that's it...Gone. Unless you have a very  specific agenda ([Cerber](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/ransom-cerber/)).

I have submitted an extensive report on this specific Malware, amongst  others for a University Module on Malware Analysis...however I will wait for it to be marked before sharing. 

Imagine a keylogger has been installed, but you then restart your Computer 30  seconds later. Unless you've entered a lot of sensitive information in  30 seconds - that'll be of no use to the author.

4. Persistence

This stage is largely why Malware is so **"noisy"**, Malware employs many techniques, of which we'll be covering in-depth  much later on. Essentially, this stage is just to make sure that the  "execution" is worth its while.

5. Propagation

Hey...If you can infect one device, why not infect more whilst you're at it?  Again, this is another reason why Malware can be so noticeable. Host  discovery generates a lot of network traffic, we'll come to this later.

**In Summary, there are two categories of fingerprints that malware may leave behind on a Host after an attack:**

Host-Based Signatures

These are generally speaking the results of execution and any persistence  performed by the Malware. For example, has a file been encrypted? Has  any additional software been installed? These are two of many, many  host-based signatures that are useful to know to prevent and check  against further infection.

Network-Based Signatures

At an overview, this classification of signatures are the observation of  any networking communication taking place during delivery, execution and propagation. For example, in Ransomware, where has the Malware  contacted for Bitcoin payments?

Such as in the case of Wannacry, looking for a large amount of "Samba"  Protocol communication attempts is a great indication of infection due  to its use of ["Eternalblue"](https://research.checkpoint.com/2017/eternalblue-everything-know/).

#  Static Vs. Dynamic Analysis                            

There are two categories used when analysing malware, these are:

1. Static Analysis

2. Dynamic Analysis

Whilst the methods and tools used for these two categories are vastly  different, they are essential in compositing an understanding of how a  malware behaves.

Static Analysis.

At its brief, "Static Analysis" is used to gain a high-level abstraction  of the sample - it can be fairly simple to decide if a piece of code is  "malicious" or not with this method alone (but not always, this will be  discussed later...). At its core, this method is of the analysis of the  sample at the state it presents itself as, without executing the code.

Employing the use of techniques such as signature analysis via checksums means  quick, efficient (albeit extremely brief) and safe analysis of malware.

Dynamic Analysis

This step is a lot more involved, and is where the abstraction of the sample is largely built upon. "Dynamic Analysis" essentially involves  executing the sample and observing what happens. This of course is not  safe. If the sample turns out to be "Ransomware" - you've now lost your  files. If it is capable of propagating via traversing a network,  nice...You've now just infected your Local Area Network (LAN).

**Please note that these are extremely simplistic explanations of these techniques**, there is a lot more involved which we will go throughout this series.

# Obtaining MD5 Checksums of Provided Files

MD5 "Checksums" are a prominent  attribute in the malware Community. Because there can be many variants  of a family of Ransomware, these MD5 "Checksums" are cryptographic  "fingerprints" of the files. This allows a uniformed identification  throughout the community - especially with automated Sandboxes. 

For example, say you have 20 files of unknown origin, you are able to  identify their genus using their MD5 sum against websites such as [Virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/), if that MD5 "Checksum" has been previously analyzed - removing all the legwork for us!

# Identifying if the Executables are obfuscated / packed                            

There are a few provided tools on this Windows instance that are capable of  identifying the compiler / packer of a file. However, PeID has a huge  database and is a great tool for this.

Moreover, just because a file doesn't have the "**.exe**" extension, doesn't mean it isn't an actual executable! For instance, it can have the ".jpg" extension and still be an executable piece of code. This is a tad-bit out of scope for this room specifically, but  essentially, files have identifying attributes within its hex - known as file headers.

E.g. The hex value for an executable is always "**4D 5A**". So if a file with a "**.jpg**" file has the hex header of "**4D 5A**", then it is obviously not a jpg file. You can read more into file headers / trailers [here](https://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html), which are great resources for data carving in file forensics / recovery.

**Tools: PeID**

# What is Obfuscation / Packing?

Packing is one form of obfuscation  that malware Authors employ to prevent the analysis of programmes. There are both legitimate and malicious reasons as to why the Author of a  program will want to prevent the decompiling of their program. 

For example, a legitimate reason is the protection of intellectual  property! Whilst I'm one for open-source as much as the next person here - alas not every organisation has the same mindset...but let's leave  that aside.

In the same  token, just because you write a program...Why should everyone have the  right to "copy" your project? This is one of the justifiable reasons for obfuscation - it is yours at the end of the day! 

However, malware Authors employ obfuscation techniques such as packing - whilst  for the same reasons, they do so with the intent to prevent people like  us reversing it to understand its behaviours and ultimately with the  aims of achieving infection.

How packing works is out of scope for this room, but I hope to be able to  delve into topics like these later on within THM, so that you can  understand the theory behind the practical skills you'll be using. 

**Tools: PeID**

# Visualising the Differences Between Packed & Non-Packed Code                            

This is another  example of why PeID is a fantastic little tool. With its huge dataset of known packers, it is arguably one of the better ones at being able to  fingerprint the names of packers / obfuscators within an application.

Whilst this tool has a huge database, it doesn't have every packer out there!  Especially say if an Author has written their own - PeID will have no  way of identifying the packer used. In cases like this, **it's more about what PeID doesn't tell us** - rather than **what it does.**

In this instance, PeID is able to detect what packer has been used to obfuscate the code. Whilst PeID is capable of detecting the possibility of packers being used, it  is not able to automatically de-obfuscate them. This is a process we  will have to do manually - at a later stage.

After confirming that this file is indeed packed, let's open it up with a tool called **IDA Freeware**. This is located in the **"Tools/Static/Disassembly" directory** (or you can search for it through Windows Toolbar). Notice how there is a very minimal amount of information provided to us? For  example, the "Imports" tab is practically empty! Little odd...right?

When opening the file, a few dialogue boxes may appear - its just IDA  Freeware processing the file, it'll take a couple of seconds.

![img](https://i.imgur.com/UB7tqdk.png)

We can see there are only two "**Imports"** in this program! That's a bit bizarre...

...The use of "IDA Free" will be developed upon as it is an advanced bit of kit. But essentially, we can see the flow of how the program executes - indicated by the  arrows. The problem? There's very little here! There are a few more  characteristics that indicate its packed, but this is also beyond the  scope for this room. 

![img](https://i.imgur.com/YtCCrw1.png)

Whereas, if we were to open a file that isn't obfuscated, we should expect to  see a much larger import count and graph/flowchart, like this:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/yOyFwrJ.png)

![img](https://i.imgur.com/XM6eSBr.png)

See how there's so much more information here? Obfuscated code is much harder to analyze at least at the static level, as we're presented with very little information!

# Introduction to Strings

Theory:

"**Strings**" are essentially the ASCII / Text contents of a program...this could be  anything from passwords for self-extracting zips, to bitcoin addresses  in ransomware samples.

Such as that in the example above, when analysing the contents of these  strings, we can sometimes paint a fairly indicative picture of the  behaviours of the programme - bitcoin wallets being used in ransomware.

Task: 

Open a Command prompt on the Windows Machine and navigate to the directory **"Tools\Sysinternalssuite"**

```
cd C:\Users\Analysis\Desktop\Tools\SysinternalsSuite
```

**Keep this terminal open.**

We're going to use Microsoft's Sysinternals "Strings" program to output the  retained strings within the specified file in "Task 12". We can do this  by:

```
strings "C:\Users\Analysis\Desktop\Tasks\Task 12\67844C01"
```

You will receive a whole load of text, most of it looks like nonsense...But there is some text in there that is valuable. Scroll up!

​          ![img](https://i.imgur.com/PZBczF7.png)

**Proceed to answering Question 1.**

You'll find that programs often contain large amount of strings and using the  "strings" tool from sysinternals may only display 10% of these...

...That and it's not exactly practical scrolling up through a terminal for  stuff like this - we are on Windows afterall! There's a GUI tool for  that.

Launch the application within **"Tools/Static/PE Tools/PE Explorer"** and **drag and drop** the same file **"67844C01"** from the previous question into the application.

Where you will be presented with the following, indicating that it has successfully imported:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/822wO58.png)     

After import. Navigate to **"View -> Imports"**

#  Introduction to Imports                            

Theory:

The classification of IDA Freeware is arguable as the tool can be used for  both static and dynamic analysis. Without going too in-depth regarding  the differences, there are two classifications of tools like IDA  Freeware:

- Disassemblers
- Debuggers

I'll allow you to explore the differences between these two types of tools  and their use cases in your own time, but for contextual sake -  Disassemblers reverse the compiled code of a program from machine code  to human-readable instructions (assembly). This is limited to how the  program represents itself in its current state! I.e. If the contents of  an executable changes during execution - "Disassemblers" will not  reflect this.

Whilst  Debuggers deploy the same techniques used by "Disassemblers",  "Debuggers" essentially facilitate execution of the program - where the  analyser can view the changes made throughout each "step" of the  program. These tools are great because a true picture of the program  presents itself. However, if it is indeed malicious, you have now  infected yourself.

With  enough understanding, an analyser can introduce "breakpoints" (or  pauses) at various stages of a program, where the program will execute  up until a breakpoint. For example, sticking with the idea of  Ransomware, an analyser can create a "breakpoint" within the application prior to the actual stage of encryption of files. This facilitates an  analyser to view the various changes of a program during execution (such as unpacking or connecting to a remote server such as that in a botnet) up until the point of malicious infection.



Practical:

For this room, we will be using IDA Freeware within the context of  statistical analysis. I'll walkthrough how to import an executable into  IDA Freeware below.

1. Lets launch "IDA Freeware" and select the file to import, in this case we'll be using "uninstall.exe"

![img](https://i.imgur.com/vmv9Xsc.png)

And navigate to the file...

![img](https://i.imgur.com/G3VAJc1.png)

 \2. Since we know it is an executable file, we select "Portable executable for 80386 (PE) [pe64.dll]"

![img](https://i.imgur.com/I9TUxXi.png)

 \3. After pressing "OK" the application will load. Allow a few minutes for the executable to be decompiled.

![img](https://i.imgur.com/wbQGqxH.png)

There are various tabs, similar to what we saw in "PE Explorer" i.e. "Imports" and "Exports".
