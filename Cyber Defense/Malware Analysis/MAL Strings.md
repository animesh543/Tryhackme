# What are "strings"?                            

﻿**What are "strings"?**﻿

From a programming perspective, "strings" is the term given for data handled by an application. At a broader view, these pieces of data are used to  store information such as text to numerical values.

For example,  let's say we have an application such as a calculator. A user will have  to input two numerical values (e.g. 1 and 5) combined with an operator  (e.g. + or plus) addition in this case. These values will be stored as  "strings".

However "strings" can be  stored within the application itself - where no input is necessary from  the user. For example, using the example of usernames and passwords is a great representation of the many types of information that may be  stored as a "string".

**Why are "strings" important?**

We're all security-minded people here and know that writing down passwords  isn't a very smart thing to do. However, developers are not quite so  likeminded and often leave credentials in applications which are often  essential i.e. An application that server needs to know the IP address  of it. Arguably, an IP address is trivial in comparison to the  sensitivity of a password - but both would be stored as strings.

There are a plethora of examples of companies storing sensitive information  such as passwords within their applications. For example, [Intellian](https://www.intelliantech.com/), a satellite-communications focused company had the disclosure of their **"Aptus Web 1.24"** application retaining a default passcode of “12345678”.

# Practical: Extracting "strings" From an Application

As displayed above, if you were to execute this on Windows you'd be  greeted with a prompt asking for a Username and password. The problem  is, we don't know what the credentials are but we want to get in! Let's  have a look into how the application understands what usernames and  passwords are right and wrong.

Load up a terminal and use the command `strings <filename>`replacing **<filename>** with the name and path of the downloaded file attached to this Task i.e. `strings /home/kali/Downloads/LoginForm.exe` 

You will see a lot of text appear - and might be cut things out! Rather  than just printing the output to the terminal, perhaps we should save it to a file? You can **"pipe"** (or direct) the output to a file. If you are not familiar with Linux, I very highly recommend the following room: [Learning Linux](https://tryhackme.com/zthlinux)

Now that we have stored the output into a file, we can do all sorts -  filter it, sort it, search it! That's what you'll need to do. Open it in a text editor - either via terminal using `nano`, `vi` or Kali's installed GUI text editor `Mousepad`

Looking through the file will show mostly garbage, but all you need is one  golden nugget! You will be able to answer the following questions with  this information. Think, what looks most likely a username and password?

# Strings in the Context of Malware

Great, developers can be lazy - they leave passwords in applications as  we have previously discussed. How does that relate to us as a malware  analyst? Well...

We've discovered that even professional  developers can "slip up" a few times, malware authors are still  developers at the end of the day.

But more specifically, malware  types such as botnets and ransomware rely upon information being stored  within strings I.e. IP Addresses so that they are able to "call home"  and connect to their "Command and Control" (C&C) server.

A  famous example is the "Wannacry" ransomware. The "killswitch" was a  domain that was discovered as a value contained within a string.

As we will later come on to discover, building a picture of the various  stages a piece of malware proceeds through is essential to prevent  further infection. Information such as who the software communicates to  I.e. IP Addresses such as in the case of a botnet, or the payment  address in the instances of ransomware is prevalent in building this  picture.

# Practical: Finding Bitcoin Addresses in Ransomware

What is Bitcoin?

At a brief overview, Bitcoin is an "anonymous" online payment currency in  the sense that there is no direct attribution between the sender and  recipient. Authors of ransomware use this currency because of this trait - however, just because there is no attribution such as real names like traditional payment methods, it is traceable by Law Enforcement (albeit difficult).
For example, Wannacry uses Bitcoin as the  payment method for the decryption of files. Bitcoin uses virtual  wallets, similar to a MAC address of a network interface card. [MuirlandOracle](https://tryhackme.com/p/MuirlandOracle) explains the concept of MAC addresses in his [Introductory: Networking room](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtonetworking), these wallets have addresses who are unique.

I.e. The Bitcoin address used by the authors of Wannacry was [13AM4VW2dhxYgXeQepoHkHSQuy6NgaEb94](https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/address/13AM4VW2dhxYgXeQepoHkHSQuy6NgaEb94/)

In this case, the previously mentioned Bitcoin address used for Wannacry  has to-date received over 20BTC (Bitcoins) from victims, which  translates into over just over £158k (as of 06/04/2020).
