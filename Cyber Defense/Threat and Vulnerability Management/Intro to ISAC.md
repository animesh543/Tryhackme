# Introduction                            

Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs), are used to share and  exchange various Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) to obtain threat  intelligence. IOCs can include MD5s, IPs, YARA rules, and more. There  are many ISACs that can be used to gather threat intelligence including  AlienVault OTX, Threat Connect, and MISP.

Malware and IOCs used in this room have been sourced from [The Zoo Malware Repository](https://github.com/ytisf/theZoo). All credit goes to the respective owners.

#  Basic Terminology                            

**APT** is an acronym for **A****dvanced Persistent Threat**. This can be considered a team/group (***threat group\***), or even country (***nation-state group\***), that engages in long-term attacks against organizations and/or  countries. The term 'advanced' can be misleading as it will tend to  cause us to believe that each APT group all have some super-weapon, e.i. a zero-day exploit, that they use. That is not the case. As we will see a bit later, the techniques these APT groups use are quite common and  can be detected with the right implementations in place. You can view  FireEye's current list of APT groups [here](https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/apt-groups.html). 

**TTP** is an acronym for **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures,** but what does each of these terms mean?

- The **Tactic** is the adversary's goal or objective.
- The **Technique** is how the adversary achieves the goal or objective.
- The **Procedure** is how the technique is executed.

**TI** is an acronym for **Threat Intelligence**. Threat Intelligence is an overarching term for all collected information on adversaries and TTPs. You will also commonly hear **CTI** or **Cyber Threat Intelligence** which is just another way of saying Threat Intelligence.

**IOCs** is an acronym for **Indicators of Compromise,** the indicators for malware and adversary groups. Indicators can include file hashes, IPs, names, etc

# What is Threat Intelligence                            

Threat Intelligence, also known as TI and Cyber Threat Intelligence  also known as, CTI, is used to provide information about the threat  landscape specifically adversaries and their TTPs. Typically CTI  revolves around APT groups and/or other threats, these can be well-known groups or up and coming new threats.

Data must be analyzed to be  considered threat intelligence. Once analyzed and actionable, then it  becomes threat intelligence. The data needs context around to become  intel.

CTI is a precautionary measure that companies use or  contribute to so that other corporations do not get hit with the same  attacks. Of course, adversaries change their TTPs all the time so the TI landscape is constantly changing.

Vendors and corporations will  sometimes share their collected CTI in what are called ISACs or  Information Sharing and Analysis Centers. ISACs collect various  indicators of an adversary that other corporations can use as a  precaution against adversaries.

Threat Intelligence is also broken up into three different types.

- **Strategic**

​	Assist senior management make informed decisions specifically about the security budget and strategies.

- **Tactical**

​	Interacts with the TTPs and attack models to identify adversary attack patterns.

- **Operational**

​	Interact with IOCs and how the adversaries operationalize.

# What are ISACs

According to the National Council of ISACs, "Information Sharing and  Analysis Centers (ISACs) are member-driven organizations, delivering  all-hazards threat and mitigation information to asset owners and  operators". ISACs can be community-centered or vendor-specific. ISACs  include CTI from threat actors as well as mitigation information in the  form of IOCs, YARA rules, etc. ISACs maintain situational awareness by  sharing and collaborating to maintain CTI, through a [National Council of ISACs](https://www.nationalisacs.org/).

You can view a list of member ISACs here: [https://www.nationalisacs.org/member-isacs](https://www.nationalisacs.org/member-isacs-3).

We will be focusing on ISACs as they pertain to cybersecurity and cyber  threat intelligence; however, ISACs can be utilized for more than just  cybersecurity.

Below is a list of ISACs that can help a blue team we will only be showcasing a few in this room.

- [US-CERT](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/)
- [AlienVault OTX](https://otx.alienvault.com/)
- [ThreatConnect](https://threatconnect.com/)
- [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/)

# Using Threat Connect to create a Threat Intel dashboard                            

**Threat Connect focuses** more on the information and new developments  within cybersecurity and the threat landscape and connecting the  landscape with indicators. This intelligence can help your team make  better-informed decisions on what to prioritize. Threat Connect would  fall under the tactical type of threat intelligence. 

There is a  free and open-source version of Threat Connect available but if you were actually using this on a security team you would want to pay for access to the full platform. Threat Connect is a very large platform with many capabilities but we will only be using it to create our threat intel  dashboard and gather indicators from other ISACs like AlienVault OTX. It is important to have multiple sources for the information or  intelligence that you collect.

Sign up for a free ThreatConnect account [here](https://threatconnect.com/).

Note: Currently ThreatConnect has gone through a new re-branding and seems to no longer offer a free account. I am looking into options for the  future.

## Creating a Threat Intel Dashboard

Straight out of the box Threat Connect comes with a pre-configured dashboard you can use, as well as 4 other more specific dashboards: Operations  Dashboard, Source Analysis, OSINT Overview, and Covid-19 Related  Activity.

We will only be covering the default dashboard in-depth  but feel free to play with other dashboards as much as you want to get  familiar with them as well as the other features ThreatConnect has.

## Breaking Down the Dashboard

We can break up the various sections of the dashboard to make it more digestible and see what each section has to offer.

- **Top Sources by Observations**

​	This section sorts observations or indicators by the owner or source of the  observation. This is helpful to find reliable sources for intelligence as a majority of threat intel is community-driven.

​	![img](https://i.imgur.com/eqXIepC.png)

- **Latest Intelligence**

​	Gives the latest intelligence that has been reported to the platform. This can be helpful if you want to stay on top of the newest rising threats.

​	![img](https://i.imgur.com/Sq1jWm5.png)

- **Top Sources by False Positives**

​	Similar to the Top Sources by Observations this will sort the owners by who has the most false positives. This can be useful to stay away from  indicator owners who generate a lot of false positives and their intel  may not be as high quality.

​	![img](https://i.imgur.com/GaaUBXN.png)

- **Top Tags**

​	This is a collection of the top tags used to categorize indicators. This can be useful to quickly find a topic or to identify trends within the  threat landscape.

​	![img](https://i.imgur.com/0llIW3Q.png)

- **Indicator Breakdown**

​	A breakdown of all of their intelligence combined and what indicators  make up the platform. This is not super helpful for most applications as it only gives a brief overview of the platform as a whole.

​	![img](https://i.imgur.com/P1VVRwk.png)

For the most part, the other sections of the dashboard could be ignored as  they are just overviews of what is on the platform rather than specific  threat intelligence.


## Custom Dashboards

You can use all of these various parts of the default dashboard to create your own personalized dashboard that fits your liking.

For example, this is part of the Operations Dashboard I like to use.

# Introduction to AlienVault OTX                            

AlienVault OTX from  AT&T Cybersecurity is one of the main ISACs that is used as an  exchange for community maintained threat intelligence.

You will need to create an AlienVault account before you can fully use the application. Go to https://otx.alienvault.com/ and create an account before continuing.

![img](https://i.imgur.com/SkV1ZBx.png)

Alienvault uses 'Pulses' to create trackers for various categories. Pulses can be  categorized by Malware type, APT or group, and targeted industry. All  pulses are community-created excluding official pulses from AlienVault. 

Pulses can include a wide variety of IOCs such as File Hashes (MD5, SHA1), IPv4, IPv6, Domain, URL, YARA, CVE, and more. 

![img](https://i.imgur.com/SEddt8E.png)



The main page of OTX you will use is the Dashboard. The default dashboard  includes a visualization of the most common active malware broken down  by category as well as a list of Subscribed Pulses. By default, only  AlienVault's Subscribed Pulses will be listed. This can be expanded upon later.

There are also six different tabs that you can navigate to on the navigation bar, they are outlined below.

- **Dashboard** - This is shown above in the screenshot above. It's the main page of  OTX and will provide a brief overview of important intel.
- **Browse** - This will allow you to see all new pulses and sort by various categories to find the newest intel.
- **Scan Endpoints** - This is an automated service called OTX Endpoint Security that will scan endpoints for indicators.
- **Create Pulse** - This will allow you to create your own pulses and contribute to the threat exchange.
- **Submit Sample** - This allows you to submit a malware sample or URL sample which OTX will analyze and generate a report based on the provided sample.
- **API Integration** - Allows synchronization of the threat exchange with other tools for monitoring your environment.

# Using OTX to gather Threat Intelligence                            

## Pulse Overview

Pulses can consist of a description, tags, indicator types (file  hash, Yara, IP, domain, etc.), and threat infrastructure (country of  origin). OTX uses pulses as their indicators. A majority of pulses are  community-created and maintained. You need to keep this in mind when  using pulses for threat intelligence as not all pulses are legit or may  contain inaccurate information. Always verify and analyze the indicators used before using them for CTI.

## Breaking Down a Pulse

First, we need to understand how to analyze and gather information from a  pulse in order to understand how to use OTX's many categories, ways of  obtaining threat intelligence, and indicators.

As an example, we will be looking at the Xanthe - Docker aware  miner pulse released from the official AlienVault account. You can find  it [here](https://otx.alienvault.com/pulse/5fc6767d4cca089129062db9).

Pulses consist of three main sections: Pulse Description, Indicator  Overview, Indicators. We will break down these sections further and  identify each component of them.

## Pulse Description

The Pulse Description consists of the description itself, references, tags, malware families, and ATT&CK IDs. The three most important parts are the reference section, the  description itself, and the ATT&CK IDs. The references can be used  to verify the pulse and get further background information on the  pulse/indicators. The description can give you a brief overview of what  the pulse is for and how it was gathered which can be useful when  quickly looking for pulses to use. The ATT&CK IDs can be used to  quickly identify what TTPs are being used by the pulse and familiarize  yourself with them. For more information about ATT&CK check out  Heavenraiza's [MITRE room](https://tryhackme.com/room/mitre).

## Indicator Overview

The Indicator Overview will give you a very brief statistical  representation of the indicators within the pulse as well as threat  infrastructure. The indicator overview can be useful when looking for a  very specific IOC like a file hash or YARA rule, etc.

![img](https://i.imgur.com/J4zKnQB.png)

From here we can see that the pulse has six different types of indicators as well as four different countries that the pulse is originating from.

*Note: A majority of pulses do not have threat infrastructure however it can be useful when analyzing a pulse for CTI.*

## Indicators 

Indicators are probably the most important section of the entire pulse. It  contains all of the indicators and information about them.

![img](https://i.imgur.com/LWW3fT7.png)

There is a lot of information to break down for each pulse. Look below for more information about each column of the indicators.

- Type - The type of indicator (URL, File Hash, IP, Domain, etc.)
- Indicator - The indicator itself
- Added - Date added, pulses can be updated this can be useful to track the pulses history
- Active - Shows, whether the indicator is still seen in the wild and active, can be useful when selecting pulses to use.
- Related Pulses - Shows pulses that share the same indicator, can be useful to cross-check indicators.
- Extra Information (Advanced) - These are the advanced options including Dynamic Analysis, Network Activity, and YARA rules. 

The Advanced section of indicators can contain the most information and  allow you to get a better understanding of what you are dealing with.  Not all pulses or indicators will contain any advanced information but  it can be very useful when available. Below is an example of a YARA  detection and dynamic analysis of a binary from a file hash.

## Finding Pulses based on Malware

If you want to find pulses only for a specific malware strain you can look for pulses based on malware. This allows you to very quickly find  IOCs and rules for a specific strain of malware.

*Note: Malware authors are constantly working to change and  mitigate indicators and signatures, be aware that indicators change when looking for specific malware indicators.*

![img](https://i.imgur.com/LVvBTDG.png)



 The menu for malware is by far the most detailed including features of  the malware, related pulses, process visualization, and file samples if  available.

![img](https://i.imgur.com/ZgWoLk0.png)



 OTX will also visualize the processes the malware is running. Overall  the malware categories will allow you to quickly identify multiple  aspects of malware including processes, features and pulses.


 ## Finding Pulses based on Adversaries

To get started with identifying pulses by adversaries you need to  have a foundational knowledge of adversaries and their operations. To  get an introduction to adversarial operations check out the [APT Groups and Operations spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H9_xaxQHpWaa4O_Son4Gx0YOIzlcBWMsdvePFX68EKU/pubhtml#). You can identify pulses based on the adversary group.

Note: Each vendor has its own naming scheme for APTs take note of this when looking for pulses by adversary.

![img](https://i.imgur.com/LlsFZ7B.png)


 The adversary menu will give you a short description of the group as well as pulses related to that group.


## Finding Pulses based on Industry

A common vector for adversaries to focus on is the industry of their  target, for example, finance, education, aerospace, etc. Adversaries  will sometimes target corporations in one specific industry. An example  of this is the Ryuk malware being distributed by "one" group targeting  financial corporations

 When opening the industry menu you will see a general description as well as any pulses tag / related to the industry.
