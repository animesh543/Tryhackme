# The Zero Day Angle                            

**About The vulnerability -** 
On September 14, Secura released a whitepaper for CVE-2020-1472, that  allowed an attacker to go from Zero to Domain Admin in approximately one minute. They dubbed this vulnerability Zero Logon.

Zero Logon is a purely statistics based attack that abuses a feature within  MS-NRPC (Microsoft NetLogon Remote Protocol), MS-NRPC is a critical  authentication component of Active Directory that handles authentication for User and Machine accounts. In short -- the attack mainly focuses on a poor implementation of Cryptography. To be more specific, Microsoft  chose to use AES-CFB8 for a function called ComputeNetlogonCredential,  which is normally fine, except they had hard coded the Initialization  Vector to use all zeros instead of a random string. When an attacker  sends a message only containing zeros with the IV of zero, there is a  1-in-256 chance that the Ciphertext will be Zero. 

But how is that useful to us? We'll touch on that note in the following sections.

**About Machine Accounts -**

Normally, if we tried a statistics based attack on any user account, we would get locked out. This is not the case if we apply this principal to machine  accounts. Machines accounts behave in a much different way than standard user accounts. They have no predefined account lockout attempts because a 64+ character alpha numeric password is normally used to secure them, making them very difficult to break into. They're not meant to be  accessed by an end user by any means. In certain circumstances, we can  dump the machine account password using a tool like Mimikatz, but if  we're at that point, we've already compromised the machine -- and we're  looking for persistence within the domain, not lateral movement.

**Abusing the Vulnerability -** 

Machine accounts often hold system level privileges which we can use for a  variety of things. If you're not familiar with Active Directory, we can  take the Domain Controller's Machine Account and attempt to use the  granted authentication in conjunction with Secretsdump.py (SecretsDump  is a password dumping utility like Mimikatz, except it lives on the  Network instead of the host) to dump all of the passwords within the  domain. At this point we have a rough kill chain starting to form:

Use Zero Logon to bypass authentication on the Domain Controller's Machine  Account -> Run Secretsdump.py to dump credentials -> Crack/Pass  Domain Admin Hashes -> ??? -> Profit

**Analyzing the MS-NRPC Logon Process -** 

At this point, we know a vulnerability exists, but we're not quite sure  how to exploit it yet. We'll be covering that soon, but what we do know  there's a vulnerability within the way Microsoft handles Authentication  within ComputeNetLogonCredetial function of MS-NRPC. To better  understand the vulnerability, we need to do a bit of a deeper dive on  how Microsoft handles authentication to NRPC.

To analyze where the vulnerability occurs, we'll be using the Diagram  provided by Secura as well as Microsoft Documentation to decipher the  magic behind Zero Logon. The sources can be found at the bottom of this  task.

**Step 1**. The client creates a NetrServerReqChallenge and sends it off *[Figure 1. Step 1]*. This contains the following values:

1. The DC

2. The Target Device (Also the DC, in our case)

3. A Nonce (In our case is 16 Bytes of Zero).

**Step 2**. The server receives the NetrServerReqChallenge, the server will then  generate it's own Nonce (This is called the Server Challenge), the  server will send the Server Challenge back. *[Figure 1. Step 2]*

**Step 3**. The client (us) will compute it's NetLogon Credentials with the Server Challenge provided *[Figure 1. Step 3]*. It uses the NetrServerAuthenticate3 method which requires the following parameters:

1. A Custom Binding Handle (Impacket handles this for us, it's negotiated prior)

2. An Account Name (The Domain Controller's machine account name. ex: DC01$)

3. A Secure Channel Type (Impacket sort of handles this for us, but we  still need to specify it:  [nrpc.NETLOGON_SECURE_CHANNEL_TYPE.ServerSecureChannel])

4. The Computer Name (The Domain Controller ex: DC01)

5. The Client Credential String (this will be 8 hextets of \x00 [16 Bytes of Zero]) 

6. Negotiation Flags (The following value observed from a Win10 client  with Sign/Seal flags disabled: 0x212fffff Provided by Secura)

**Step 4**. The server will receive the NetrServerAuthenticate request and will  compute the same request itself using it's known, good values. If the  results are good, the server will send the required info back to the  client. *[Figure 1. Step 4.]*

At this  point the attempt to exploit the Zero Logon vulnerability is under way.  The above steps above will be looped through a certain number of times  to attempt to exploit the Zero Logon vulnerability. The actual exploit  occurs at Step 3 and 4, this where we're hoping for the Server to a have the same computations as the client. This is where are 1-in-256 chance  comes in.

**Step 5**. If the server  calculates the same value, the client will re-verify and once mutual  agreement is confirmed, they will agree on a session key. The session  key will be used to encrypt communications between the client and the  server, which means authentication is successful. *[Figure 1. Step 5]*

# The Proof of Concept

**PoC and You -** 

Proof of Concepts are incredibly important to every exploit, without them,  the exploit's are almost entirely theoretical. Fortunately, Secura was  able to provide a working [Proof of Concept for Zero Logon](https://github.com/SecuraBV/CVE-2020-1472) that was 90% of the way there. We simply need to make an additional  call to change the password to a null value, recall Figure 3 from Task  1, Secura was even kind enough to give us the method that we need to  call ([NetrServerPasswordSet2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-nrpc/14b020a8-0bcf-4af5-ab72-cc92bc6b1d81)). Looking up the method within the Microsoft Documentation, it's very similar to [hNetSeverAuthenticate3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-nrpc/3a9ed16f-8014-45ae-80af-c0ecb06e2db9), so we're going to re-use some of the same variables from that, as well as the structure.

**Analyzing the PoC -** 

Before we continue any further, you should download the PoC from Secura, which can be found here:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SecuraBV/CVE-2020-1472/master/zerologon_tester.py

Lines **1-4** import the required modules from Impacket, specifically the  NRPC, EPM, Crypto, and Transport libraries. Additionally, on lines 6-8 a handful of other misc libraries are also imported, however, the  Impacket libraries are the star of the show here. Lastly, on line 9,  we're defining a constant (similar to a variable, but never changes)  that sets the maximum number of retries for Zero Logon to 2000.

**Lines 76 - 86**

Next we skipped down to the very bottom of the script so some other  variables will make sense later, Line 1 is essentially declaring a main  function within Python, Line 2 we are checking for the amount of  parameters, and ensuring that it's exactly 3 (zerologon_tester.py DCNAME IP). Lines 3-5 are printing the help menu only if it's greater than 3  arguments, or less than 2 and exiting. If the required arguments are  supplied, on line 8 the arguments are being passed into two variables:  dc_name, and dc_ip. After the arguments are passed, dc_name is being  stripped of the "$" character, as the dc_name variable shouldn't have  it. The user account name should however. Afterwards, it's passing the  variables two variables and an additional, modified variable into a  module called "perform_attack".

**Lines 57 - 73**

Line 1 is defining where the variables are being passed into for the  local function, \\DCNAME is being passed into the dc_handle variable,  dc_ip is being passed into dc_ip variable, and dc_name is being passed  into the target_computer variable. All of which will be used later, or  passed into different modules.

Line 4 sets the variable rpc_con equal to none, this will be kept track of consistently to check and see if authentication is successful, if it's not, the script will  continue until 2000 retries is hit. Line 5 is where the actual retries  for Zero Logon occurs in the form of a for loop. Line 6 sets the rpc_con variable to the output of a different function called  "try_zero_authenticate" with a couple of variables being passed to it,  specifically dc_handle, dc_ip, and target_computer. All of which we  addressed earlier. The next lines are simply checking if rpc_con is  equal to a invalid login attempt, if it is, print =, if not, print  success, if 2000 retries is hit: print attack failed.

**Lines 20-25**

Line 1 is defining the try_zero_authenticate function and is taking the  previously mentioned 3 variables as input, and is passing them into the  function. Lines 3-6 are establishing a bind and a session with NRPC over TCP/IP so that we can communicate with the domain controller.

**Lines 27-40**

Line 1 and 2 are establishing two new variables, plaintext and  ciphertext containing 16 Bytes of "\x00" which will be used to exploit  the Zero Logon vulnerability. Line 4 contains a variable called Flags.  These are the default flags observed from a Windows 10 Client (using  AES-CFB8) with the Sign and Seal bit disabled (Source/Credit: Secura).

Line 6 is where the fun beings -- This is where Step 1 beings in Figure 1,  the client creates a NetrServerReqChallenge containing the following  information required by the [Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-nrpc/5ad9db9f-7441-4ce5-8c7b-7b771e243d32):

The Primary Name being the DC Handle, the Computer Name being the  Target Computer, and the Client Challenge being 16 bytes of "\x00". And the client will receive back, which will be used in Figure 1, Step 2:

Lines 8 sets up a try except (we'll see the rest of that in the next few lines), but in line 9 is where we actually attempt to exploit the Zero  Logon vulnerability, this would be Figure 1, Step 3. This section  requires a fair bit more information, per the Microsoft Documentation  for [NetrServerAuthenticate3](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-nrpc/3a9ed16f-8014-45ae-80af-c0ecb06e2db9), the following is required: 

On line 9, we supply the DC_Handle as the Primary Name, the Target  Computer plus a $ as the Machine Account Name (Recall, Machine accounts  do not have lockout policies), the Secure Channel Type as the Secure  Channel Type previously established over RPC, the target_computer  variable as the ComputerName, the Ciphertext (16 bytes of "\x00"  attempting to Abuse Zero Logon, remember there's 1-in-256 chance that  the Ciphertext will be the same as the plaintext), and lastly, our flags variable that mimics those of a Windows 10 client machine.

Additionally, we expect to receive two  (possibly 3) things back from the Server upon (hopefully) successful  exploitation of Zero Logon: The ServerCredential and AccountRid, only  one of which we are going to use.

 **Line 44 - 54**

Line 1 is retrieving the Error Code from the Server_auth variable, or the variable assigned to establish an  Authentication Session with the target device. If successful, we're  going to return the rpc_con variable which will inform us that we have  successfully bypassed Authentication with Zero Logon. Lines 3-12 are  simply Error handling lines so the program doesn't break and exit after  receiving an error back.
