# What is Yara?

 **All about Yara** 

*"The pattern matching swiss knife for malware researchers (and everyone else)" ([Virustotal., 2020](https://virustotal.github.io/yara/))*

With such a fitting quote, Yara can identify information based on both  binary and textual patterns, such as hexadecimal and strings contained  within a file.

Rules are used to label these  patterns. For example, Yara rules are frequently written to determine if a file is malicious or not, based upon the features - or patterns - it  presents.

Strings are a fundamental component of programming languages. Applications use strings to store data such as text.

For example, the code snippet below prints "Hello World" in Python. The text "Hello World" would be stored as a string.

#  Introduction to Yara Rules                            

The proprietary language that Yara uses for rules is fairly trivial to pick up, hard to master. This is because your rule is only as effective  as your understanding of the patterns you want to search for.

Using a Yara rule is simple. Every `yara` command requires two arguments to be valid, these are:
**1)** The rule file we create
**2)** Name of file, directory, or process ID to use the rule for.

Every rule must have a name and condition.

For example, if we wanted to use "myrule.yar" on directory "some directory" we would use the following command:
`yara myrule.yar somedirectory`

Note that **.yar** is the standard file extension for all Yara rules.

We'll make one of the most basic rules you can make below.

**1.** Make a file named "**somefile**" via `touch somefile`
**2.** Open a new file and name it "**myfirstrule.yar**" like below:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/RgUnRmI.png)

\3. With this open, input the snippet below and save the file:

```
rule examplerule {    condition: true}
```

![img](https://i.imgur.com/42tCO1G.png)

The **name** of the rule in this snippet is `examplerule`, where we have one condition - in this case, the **condition** is `condition`. As previously discussed, every rule requires both a name and a  condition to be valid. This rule has satisfied those two requirements.

Simply, the rule we have made checks to see if the file/directory/PID that we specify exists via `condition: true`. If the file does exist, we are given the output of `examplerule` 

Let's give this a try on the file **"some file"** that we made in step one:
`yara myfirstrule.yar somefile`

If "some file" exists, Yara will say `examplerule` because the pattern has been met - as we can see below:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/fhl1SmW.png)

If the file does not exist, Yara will output an error such as that below:

##  Expanding on Yara Rules

###  Yara Conditions Continued...

Checking whether or not a file exists isn't all that helpful. After all, we can  figure that out for ourselves...Using much better tools for the job.

Yara has a few conditions, which I encourage you to read [here](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/writingrules.html) at your own leisure. However, I'll detail a few below and explain their purpose.

| Keyword    |
| ---------- |
| Desc       |
| Meta       |
| Strings    |
| Conditions |
| Weight     |

### Meta

This section of a Yara rule is reserved for descriptive information by the  author of the rule. For example, you can use `desc`, short for  description, to summarise what your rule checks for. Anything within  this section does not influence the rule itself. Similar to commenting  code, it is useful to summarise your rule.

### Strings

Remember our discussion about strings in Task 2? Well, here we go. You can use  strings to search for specific text or hexadecimal in files or programs. For example, say we wanted to search a directory for all files  containing "Hello World!", we would create a rule such as below:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/TzxFGbd.png)


We define the keyword `Strings` where the string that we want to search, i.e., "Hello World!" is stored within the variable `$hello_world`

Of course, we need a condition here to make the rule valid. In this  example, to make this string the condition, we need to use the  variable's name. In this case, `$hello_world`:



![img](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/yara/helloworld_checker_con1.png)

Essentially, if any file has the string "Hello World!" then the rule will match.  However, this is literally saying that it will only match if "Hello  World!" is found and will not match if "hello world" or "HELLO WORLD."To solve this, the condition `any of them` allows multiple strings to be searched for, like below:

![img](https://i.imgur.com/TGFw8sH.png)

Now, any file with the strings of:

\- Hello World!

\- hello world

\- HELLO WORLD

Will now trigger the rule.

### Conditions

We have already used the `true` and `any of them` condition. Much like regular programming, you can use operators such as:

**<=** less than or equal to

**>=** more than or equal to

**!=** not equal to

For example, the rule below would do the following:

![img](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/yara/helloworld_checker.png)


The rule will now: 

\- Look for the "Hello World!" string
\- Only say the rule matches if there are less than or equal to ten occurrences of the "Hello World!" string

### Combining keywords

Moreover, you can use keywords such as:

**and**

**not**

**or** 

To combine multiple conditions. Say if you wanted the rule to match if any `.txt` files with "Hello World!" is found, you can use a rule like below:



![img](https://i.imgur.com/jkADv0i.png)


The rule will only match if both conditions are true. To illustrate: below, the rule we created, in this case, did not match because although the  file has "Hello World!" it does not have the `.txt` extension:



![img](https://i.imgur.com/QUlYcPQ.png)

However, the rule matched this time because the file has both "Hello World!" and the `.txt` extension.



![img](https://i.imgur.com/BGpRIDV.png)

Remembering that the text within the red box is the name of our rule, and the text within the green is the matched file.

Anatomy of a Yara Rule

![img](https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*gThGNPenpT-AS-gjr8JCtA.png)

Information security researcher "fr0gger_" has recently created a [handy cheatsheet](https://medium.com/malware-buddy/security-infographics-9c4d3bd891ef#18dd) that breaks down and visualises the elements of a YARA rule (shown  above, all image credits go to him). It's a great reference point in  getting started!

# Yara Modules                            

Frameworks such as the [Cuckoo Sandbox](https://cuckoosandbox.org/) or [Python's PE Module](https://pypi.org/project/pefile/) allows you to improve the technicality of your Yara rules ten-fold.

## Cuckoo

Cuckoo Sandbox is an automated malware analysis environment. This module  allows you to generate Yara rules based upon the behaviours discovered  from Cuckoo Sandbox. As this environment executes malware, you can  create rules on specific behaviours such as runtime strings and the  likes.

## Python PE

Python's PE module allows you to create Yara rules from the various sections and elements of the Windows Portable Executable (PE) structure.

Explaining this structure is out of scope as it is covered in my [malware introductory room](https://tryhackme.com/room/malmalintroductory). However, this structure is the standard formatting of all executables  and DLL files on windows. Including the programming libraries that are  used. 

Examining a PE file's contents is an  essential technique in malware analysis; this is because behaviours such as cryptography or worming can be largely identified without reverse  engineering or execution of the sample.

# Other tools and Yara

Knowing how to create custom Yara rules  is useful, but luckily you don't have to create many rules from scratch  to begin using Yara to search for evil. There are plenty of GitHub [resources](https://github.com/InQuest/awesome-yara) and open source tools (along with commercial products) that can be utilized to leverage Yara in hunt operations and/or incident response  engagements. 

**LOKI (what, not who, is Loki?)**

LOKI is a free open source IOC (*Indicator of Compromise*) scanner created/written by Florian Roth. 

Based on the GitHub page, detection is based on 4 methods:

1. File Name IOC Check
2. Yara Rule Check **(we are here)**
3. Hash Check
4. C2 Back Connect Check

There are additional checks that LOKI can be used for. For a full rundown, please reference the GitHub readme. 

LOKI can be used on both Windows and Linux systems. Windows users can download the binary file ([here](https://github.com/Neo23x0/Loki/releases)), which will run on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems. Linux users can use the same link to download LOKI.

**THOR** **(\*superhero named programs for a superhero blue teamer)\***

THOR *Lite* is Florian's newest multi-platform IOC AND YARA scanner. There are precompiled versions for Windows, Linux, and macOS. A nice feature with THOR Lite is its scan throttling to  limit exhausting CPU resources. For more information and/or to download  the binary, start [here](https://www.nextron-systems.com/thor-lite/). You need to subscribe to their mailing list to obtain a copy of the binary. **Note that THOR is geared towards corporate customers**. THOR Lite is the free version.

**FENRIR (naming convention still mythical themed)**

This is the 3rd [tool](https://github.com/Neo23x0/Fenrir) created by Neo23x0 (Florian Roth). You guessed it; the previous 2 are  named above. The updated version was created to address the issue from  its predecessors, where requirements must be met for them to function.  Fenrir is a bash script; it will run on any system capable of running  bash (nowadays even Windows).

**YAYA (\*Yet Another Yara Automaton\*)**

YAYA was created by the [EFF](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/introducing-yaya-new-threat-hunting-tool-eff-threat-lab) (*Electronic Frontier Foundation*) and released in September 2020. Based on their website, "*YAYA is a new open-source tool to help researchers manage multiple YARA rule repositories. YAYA starts by importing a set of high-quality YARA rules and then lets researchers add their own rules, disable specific  rulesets, and run scans of files.*"

Note: Currently, YAYA will only run on Linux systems. 

![img](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/yara/yara4.png)

In the next section, we will examine [LOKI](https://github.com/Neo23x0/Loki) further...

# Using LOKI and its Yara rule set                            

As a security  analyst, you may need to research various threat intelligence reports,  blog postings, etc. and gather information on the latest tactics and  techniques used in the wild, past or present. Typically in these  readings, IOCs (hashes, IP addresses, domain names, etc.) will be shared so rules can be created to detect these threats in your environment,  along with Yara rules. On the flip side, you might find yourself in a  situation where you've encountered something unknown, that your security stack of tools can't/didn't detect. Using tools such as Loki, you will need to add your own rules based on your threat intelligence  gathers or findings from an incident response engagement (forensics). 

As mentioned before, Loki already has a set of Yara rules that we can  benefit from and start scanning for evil on the endpoint straightaway.

```python
sudo python loki.py -p
```

# Creating Yara rules with yarGen                            

From the previous section, we realized that we have a file that Loki  didn't flag on. At this point, we are unable to run Loki on other web  servers because if **file 2** exists in any of the webs servers, it will go undetected. 

We need to create a Yara rule to detect this specific web shell in our  environment. Typically this is what is done in the case of an incident,  which is an event that affects/impacts the organization in a negative  fashion.

We can manually open the file and attempt to sift  through lines upon lines of code to find possible strings that can be  used in our newly created Yara rule. 

Let's check how many lines this particular file has. You can run the following: `strings <file name> | wc -l`.

![img](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/yara/yara8.png)

If you try to go through each string, line by line manually, you should quickly realize that this can be a daunting task. 

![img](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/yara/yara9.png)

Luckily, we can use [yarGen](https://github.com/Neo23x0/yarGen) (yes, another tool created by Florian Roth) to aid us with this task. 

What is yarGen? yarGen is a generator for YARA rules.

From the README - "*T**he main principle is the creation of yara rules from strings found in  malware files while removing all strings that also appear in goodware  files. Therefore yarGen includes a big goodware strings and opcode  database as ZIP archives that have to be extracted before the first use*."

Navigate to the `yarGen` directory, which is within `tools`. If you are running yarGen on your own system, you need to update it first by running the following command: `python3 yarGen.py --update`.

![img](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/yara/yara10.png)

This will update the good-opcodes and good-strings DB's from the online repository. This update will take a few minutes. 

 Once it has been updated successfully, you'll see the following message at the end of the output.

![img](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/yara/yara11.png)

To use yarGen to generate a Yara rule for file 2, you can run the following command: 

```
python3 yarGen.py -m /home/cmnatic/suspicious-files/file2 --excludegood -o /home/cmnatic/suspicious-files/file2.yar
```

A brief explanation of the parameters above:

- `-m` is the path to the files you want to generate rules for
- `--excludegood` force to exclude all goodware strings (*these are strings found in legitimate software and can increase false positives*)
- `-o` location & name you want to output the Yara rule

If all is well, you should see the following output.

![img](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/yara/yara12b.png)

Generally, you would examine the Yara rule and remove any strings that you feel might generate false positives. For this exercise, we will leave the generated Yara rule as is and test to see if Yara will flag file 2 or no. 

**Note**: Another tool created to assist with this is called [yarAnalyzer](https://github.com/Neo23x0/yarAnalyzer/) (you guessed it - created by Florian Roth). We will not examine that  tool in this room, but you should read up on it, especially if you  decide to start creating your own Yara rules. 

# Valhalla

**Valhalla** is an online Yara feed created and hosted by [Nextron-Systems](https://www.nextron-systems.com/valhalla/) (erm, Florian Roth). By now, you should be aware of the ridiculous amount of  time and energy Florian has dedicated to creating these tools for the  community. Maybe we should have just called this the Florian Roth room.  (lol)

Per the website, "*VALHALLA boosts your detection capabilities with the power of thousands of hand-crafted high-quality YARA rules.*"
